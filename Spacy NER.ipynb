       "\" though the movie is controversial in a few aspects and alleged cia propaganda it's nonetheless a good movie from a good director.incredible movie one of the best movies_i've seen in a whilethis is a must_see they go ham i would totally watch it againgood movie worth buying.in your face without the glorification.on of the most perfect movies_i've seen anyone that can watch this please do it's an amazing well_acted well shot and directed movie.compelling movie if the plot resembles us international communications but did our informants in the middle_east really talk that easily those who identified bin_laden's courier and why have we heard so little about maya while the supposed seal s who shot bin_laden get all the press gee the americans love big noting themselvesthere were positive and negative aspects to zero_dark thirty some of which i am not sure where to lay praise or blame for example the previous knowledge this viewer had of the capture and killing of osama_bin laden seemed to distract from the movie while the context leading_up to the final scenes proved insightful the pace felt a little off again however i can't be sure of whether myself or the movie is to blame speaking as objectively as possible chastain's performance was riveting her determination and fire happened to be quite endearing and provided the interest necessary to maintain focus on such a long movie details were followed quite well although a small omission from the raid scene was noticed even so the film should be commended for its equal representation of good bad and ugly the detainee scenes especially lacked pretension i hope this parallel has been made before but i couldn't help comparing the film to its oscar winning rival argo both films centre around international conflict and both paint the united_states in an ultimately positive light nevertheless argo definitely added more suspense to the adapted recount of real events in all honesty though zero_dark thirty is the more important story to tell and it is in its unwavering truth where its success is found.this is a classic fit for history channelgreat example of what our intelligence community does for a living even_though you knew what the ending was the suspense leading_up to it was extremely well done.something about this movie made me not like it as much as i expected crazy story though.it's definitely not a happy film but interesting watch zero_dark thirty is a excellent in the fact that it shows that in the war on terror no one is really the good guy it's a case of us vs them and morality comes in 1000 shades of gray.couldn't wait to see it and glad i did see it the hype of this movie is why people wanted to see it so bad it is a snooze fest until the last_30 minutes although in the last_30 minutes it makes you feel proud to be american and that is why it got this many stars from me.disappointing film consumed in the first hour with gratuitous scenes of torture that in reality garnered little to no actionable intelligence that alone detracts from the nobleness of the cia_agent who continued to follow this one lead gained without torture though one would never guess that based_on this film the final half_hour showing the raid on bin_laden's compound is excellent film making and a scene worth_watching thus the second of five stars here in this review.as with the hurt_locker a grossly overrated film good acting but didn't feel any real interest in any of the characters very clinical and at_times boring the subject_matter is very interesting but felt it needed more humanising.looks like a great film haven't_seen it yet but i want to go hollywood the best part of the movie comes after you have_been on the edge of your_seat expecting action.the film's accuracy may be questionable but it is a fascinating account of the cia operation to hunt for the whereabouts of osama_bin laden chastain plays the lead as a relentless agent desperately convinced she has determined the key to unlocking the mystery chastain had an incredible 2011 with the help and tree of life but has cemented herself as an a lister with one of the year's best performances her depiction of a sensitive green agent who gradually becomes hardened and ruthless is exceptional the story does become repetitive at_times which unnecessarily added to its length but has numerous instances of high drama and nail biting suspense that will keep you glued to your seats.so close no matter how farcouldn't be much more from the heartforever trusting who we areno nothing else matters metallica nothing else matters hated it don't see thiscritics have eaten it up but treated simply as a film for entertainment purposes and not a reenactment zero_dark thirty leaves a lot to be desired and is sure to put you asleep more than once.loved this movie smart well delivered and interesting characters one of the best movies_i've seen for awhile i believe this movie outshines argo based_on character_development but not on suspense.this movie received way too much hype slow and a boring lead characteri have to say i was a bit disappointed in this film zero_dark thirty focuses on the goal to terminate osama_bin laden while the actual invasion of his hiding place lasts about 5 minutes the story leading_up to that is the primary focus of the movie.nothing new here at all listen this was kinda boring to be honest it was filmed well the acting is fine special_effects and sound is well_done the story though is boring you follow some journalist around for most of the movie and then get some generic fight stuff at the end and leave the movie not even feeling that great i just found it rather vanilla i would recommend this for people that really love shows like ncis csi or svu it comes off as a prime time drama tv show.a smart provocative look at the hunt for osama_bin laden as well as the war on terror itself.well produced and directed very realistic and handled tastefully lacks action feels a little drawn out rent.this has guts personally i saw a lot of frightening parallelism between maya and the u.s and i appreciated her character arc there are many ugly but necessary themes to face in this film.difficult to watch but an expertly crafted portrayal of a fascinating narrative nearly flawless execution from cinematography to pacing to performances don't need to see it again though it's really tough stuff.concise overrated it simply couldn't compete with amour or life of pi at the oscars.maya lambert jessica_chastain a young u.s central intelligence agency officer in 2003 has spent her entire brief career since graduating from high school focused solely on gathering intelligence related to osama_bin laden leader of al_qaeda following the terrorist organization's september_11 attacks in the united_states she has just been reassigned to the u.s embassy in pakistan to work with a fellow officer dan jason_clarke during the first months of her assignment maya often accompanies dan to a black site for his continuing interrogation of ammar al baluchi a detainee with suspected links to several of the 9_11 hijackers dan subjects the detainee to torture including waterboarding and humiliation he and maya eventually trick ammar into divulging that an old acquaintance who is using the alias abu_ahmed is working as a personal courier for bin_laden other detainees corroborate this with some claiming abu_ahmed delivers messages between bin_laden and a man referred to as abu_faraj in 2005 abu_faraj is apprehended by the c.i.a and local police in pakistan maya interrogates abu_faraj under torture but he continues to deny knowing a courier with such a name maya interprets this as an attempt by abu_faraj to conceal the importance of abu_ahmed maya continues to sift through masses of data and information using a variety of technology hunches and sharing insights she concentrates on finding abu_ahmed determined to use him to find bin_laden during a span of five years she survives the 2008 islamabad marriott hotel bombing as well as being shot at in her car by armed men dan departing on reassignment warns maya about a possible change in politics suggesting that the new administration may prosecute those officers who had been involved in torture maya's fellow officer and friend jessica is killed in the 2009 camp chapman attack a jordanian detainee claims the man previously identified as abu_ahmed from a photograph is a man he personally buried in 2001 several c.i.a officers maya's seniors conclude the target who could be abu_ahmed is long dead and that they have searched a false trail for nine years however maya has strong beliefs that abu_ahmed is still alive and the person they are looking for and thus continues her research and hunt for bin_laden zero_dark thirty is based as said on the hunt for osama_bin laden and it has a mix of reality and fiction kathryn_bigelow is one of the worlds finest action directors and i have great respect for her body of work however i have always been a bit weary over movies based_on a true_story unless you have no idea about the foundation of the true_story in this case there s hardly anyone who doesn t know anything about the hunt for bin_laden thus the story is very exposed in many ways and we know the result of it does this then make zero_dark thirty still interesting and intriguing as a movie both yes and no bigelow is great at infusing large scale action set_pieces with human elements and the pain the suffering and the compromised ideals that led to the killing of bin_laden is evident here but personally i am not convinced emotionally acting wise specifically i love jessica_chastain but she is not fully convincing me as maya despite her effort to balance maya s strong emotions with being a cold result driven cia_agent almost like she just didn t manage to fall into the character fully on critic katey rich of the guardian said telling a nearly three hour story with an ending everyone_knows bigelow and boal have managed to craft one of the most intense and intellectually challenging films of the year i disagree with that it s not that intellectually challenging and it s not that intense in my book even if we see all the shady stuff that went on behind the scenes for me zero_dark thirty is more of a prolonged transport stretch to a result i already_know roger ebert of the chicago sun times gave the film three stars out of four and said the film's opening scenes are not great filmmaking they're heavy on jargon and impenetrable calculation murky and heavy on theory he went on my guess is that much of the fascination with this film is inspired by the unveiling of facts unclearly seen there isn't a whole lot of plot basically just that maya thinks she is right and she is the last half of the film really upped the rating for me the first bit did drag slightly although it was interesting but certainly the climactic ending was worth the wait very well_done by chastain and the rest of the cast.it was ok just it felt more like a documentaryreputo questo film il migliore del 2012 kathryn_bigelow si rivela ancora una volta la regista donna pi\\xc3\\xb9 brava in circolazione la sua regia in questo film \\xc3\\xa8 qualcosa di assurdo la sceneggiatura di mark_boal sembra essere fedele alla storia e a mio parere molto potente nel fornire dialoghi all'ottimo cast guidato da una straordinaria jessica_chastain alla sua migliore interpretazione che con le sue strazianti e sincere espressioni conduce una caccia lunga dieci anni al fine di trovare bin laden.very sad it was something else great insight glad i saw this you should see it too to long and didn't get to the action until the last 20_minutes piece of trashvery controversial film impossible to not look at our society in relation to how we deal with modern war terrorism this is not a feel good film but is a very important film.this movie just gets better and better as it went along by the end you dont want to blink and miss the way the seals catch ubl excellent flickreally more about the lead characters emotional progression into her obsession with catching and killing bin_laden then it was about the overall hunt for him which is a good thing a far more interesting and engaging story.gritty and realisticgood story good mixture of action and drama.i had the good fortune to watch this with a former intelligence officer no lie without whom i would have_been considerably more confused really good depiction of dramatic events it deals with.i wonder if we will ever know fact from fiction was a little long at the beginning but the last hour or so was riveting.though still glimmering with bigelow's unique take on historical war films and containing an excellent performance by jessica_chastain i found zero_dark thirty to be largely a disappointment slow paced and anti climactic it is nothing more than an average political drama.it has its periods of action but it is not until the last 40_minutes when it really gets excitinga searing intelligent and quite often uncomfortable movie.jessica chastain gives a towering performance and is ably supported by great turns from jason_clarke mark strong and james gandolfini.there are many questions raised by this movie on the nature of torture the cost of the hunt for bin_laden and the price of obsession on a person's life.so realistic and captivating the technical aspects were very close to the real event a must_see expertly filmed and acted.gripping edge of your_seat tension it gives a realistic account of the hunt and death of bin_laden it completely defied my expectations great to see more films that are continuity correct and this chick director isn't afraid to get her hands dirty go england a little too politically correct and a little too american centric history's greatest_manhunt world's most_dangerous man surely americans would think that but the other 6.6 billion of us might think differently the hurt_locker was better.bigelow can film an environment like no other as a purple heart iraq vet i honestly think her aesthetic tone is definitely something to be remembered.i disliked this movie until i realized something chastain's character at the end is realizing that she had turn into a zealot a weapon to be aimed and fired she was responsible for a murder and for that realization i give this movie full marks for not pulling punches the acting was mediocre except for jason_clarke that's my only beef with it.kathryn bigelow's zero_dark thirty is a taut logistical dramatization of the hunt for osama_bin laden that successfully functions as both a gripping drama and a slice of cinematic journalism.very long movie very slowuna parte de la versi\\xc3\\xb3n 2 hours 37 mins i wish it could be longer the build_up was nicely paced the source led from one to another till they eventually located bl hideout and bang the hurt_locker and zero_dark thirty what's next thought_provoking and gritty.don't know why it was in oscar run i could of waited til it came out on netflix greatest telling of the most difficult manhunts ever very great storyline but could of done a lot more with the time given in the movie.zero dark_thirty argogood film slow in the beginning most of the true_story is there but some is not 100 accuratebra som film nja intressant som fan ja pretty much a bore up until the end.simply fantastic better_than the hurt_locker by a mile i was literally glued to the screen the entire time chastain's powerhouse performance and bigelow's innovative directing style leads this film to a huge success definitely the best film of 2012 not as brilliant as what others claim it to be in my_opinion way too relaxed and lacks the tension but nailed it in terms of solace.realistic and well made but i never found myself caught in the clutches of suspense due to the fact that i already knew how it would all end.mais outro ano se passou e mais outro filma\\xc3\\xa7o com a jessica chainstain saiu a hora mais escura foi o meu terceiro filme favorito entre todos os indicados ao oscar de melhor filme do ano passado um filme que conquista pela dire\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xa3o da diretora kathryn_bigelow que se revela tamb\\xc3\\xa9m como uma das melhores

have_been betterzero dark_thirty is a very interesting film jessica_chastain does very well in this film but is a little long i enjoyed the ending.good little overblown.kathryn bigelow presents an intense retelling of the hunt for osama_bin laden i'm not sure how historically accurate the story is but it makes for a good movie i think it does a good job of presenting the moral dilemma of the balance of the need to maintain public safety and the extreme ways to obtain information to keep the public safe.great acting very realistic and it finally explained what_happened because for me i never really knew.zero dark_thirty is a brilliant important piece of cinema regardless of its actual accuracy to the military it's still masterfully written shot and directed and asks a lot of complicated questions 10 10great movie the viewer must understand however that this is a dramatized version of what really happened the general facts are there but one must remember that not all of what you see is true hollywood and real_life seldom mix lol that aside great acting great script amazing cinematography and edge of your_seat suspense make for a film that is a must_see for not only americans but for the entire world as well.there is nothing else to say except very well made this was an awesome movie true_story and its just such an intresting movie.re teaming with writer producer mark_boal this is director producer kathryn_bigelow's highly controversial look at the decade_long manhunt for osama_bin laden.controversial not so much because of the subject_matter but mostly because of how the filmmakers may or may not have acquired their information and the fact that the some think the film is fascistic pro torture propaganda honestly i do recognize that the film is propaganda but not to a major level like something done by leni riefenstahl and while the film does contain some unflinchingly uncomfortable and highly realistic portrayals of torture it comes off to me as just a way to help get stuff accomplished i mean you could really turn this film into a big debate piece but i think i'd rather just look at it as a history based procedural.we get a look at the cia's efforts filtered through the lens of composite character maya a woman who has no friends no family at_least none mentioned and outside of her job no life she will stop at nothing to find bin_laden and bring him down no matter what kind of toll it takes or the hoops she has to jump through.maya is a very one dimensional character but is nevertheless fascinating to watch jessica_chastain is amazing here and she really brings that sense of frenzied determination to life wonderfully jason_clarke is also great as dan a cia intelligence specialist who is really into torture and not the kind of guy i'd want to be interrogated by.in supporting roles of varying lengths we get kyle_chandler as the cia's islamabad station chief james_gandolfini as the cia director jennifer_ehle as a senior analyst mark strong as a senior supervisor harold perrineau as an intelligence analyst and joel_edgerton chris_pratt callan mulvey and taylor kinney as the more notable navy_seals featured here ie seal_team six all these people put in some decent work even if a lot of them just seem indistinguishable from one another at_times despite already knowing the ending i found this to be pretty suspenseful at_times quite intense for almost the whole running_time and rather interesting in terms of seeing how it all went down and the behind the scenes procedural and policy efforts the film is well shot decently edited and the music is quite effective too probably the most gripping moments are the torture scenes during the first act and then the impressive recreation of the raid on the compound during the finale these are some impressive done sequences even if they can be tough to sit through especially the torture stuff all in all this is a decent movie i do think it's overrated and yeah some of what is depicted and how the access to the info was done are questionable and yeah it does have an edge of rah rah go usa patriotism and you still propaganda but without that you still have an engaging action military intelligence procedural drama and that's okay by me.superb suspenseful gripping but like many was uncomfortable about what it seemed to be saying about the use of torture well_acted but a muddles plotzero dark_thirty is a breathtaking film the writing perfect the acting perfect the direction perfect the movie absolutly perfect the film follows more of how the cia went about it yes there is some action here and there but the film is more about the hunt but the last 40_minutes is probably some of the most intense climaxes ever fantastic film 5 5 good movie interesting story the last_30 min were by far the most riveting so it got an extra half star jessica_chastain was fine.i remember looking forward to this movie i then went to see it i walked out my mind was blown this was my_favourite movie of 2012 it's just a masterpiece the makers of this movie did something unbelievable they made a movie where you know what the outcome is suspenseful the raid of the house at the end is some of the best film making i've_ever seen the way kathryn_bigelow used the soldier's night_vision goggles is just genius every little noise in that scene made me jump it was fantastic i hear lots of people say that this movie was boring but i wasn't bored at all this movie kept my attention for all 2 hours and 37 minutes.i do have two problems with the movie the torture scene at the beginning was a little excessive and i feel that it set up a slightly wrong tone for the rest of the movie but it was close my other complaint is and several other people have pointed this out as well there seems to be a lack of character_development there was some for maya but not a lot for the other characters in the beginning maya was not really used to the torturing and war as seen in the beginning but she later grows to be a bad ass person who will literally stop at nothing to achieve her goal.my score for zero_dark thirty is a 10 out of 10 nice try to justify the murder of santa clauzshe's done it again fantastic enjoy for such a long movie it was amazing that we end up knowing so little it spends a lot of time on interrogations and way too little time explaining maya's background she seems to have much more knowledge about local customs and about how the terrorists think than her counterparts why how despite a great cast and perfect performances this film offers no information we didn't already get fromwatching the news.quite a surprise entertaining gripping although we all know the ending.compelling dark drama effectively brings the tale of bin ladin's capture to life could use some stronger character_development but i guess that's not really what the film's about good action.action pack movie n good to see we killed who was responsible for 9 11what is known as the greatest_manhunt in human history has finally been turned into a film now while i disagree with that i understand bin_laden has had a hand in some of the most despicable acts against humanity zero_dark thirty chronicles the hunt for bin_laden from the attacks of 9_11 all the way up to his death in his compound they say the thrill of the hunt is more rewarding than the kill in the case of this film it ends up being the other way around not in a patriotic sense but in a cinematic sense the film leading_up to the operation is filled with great performances but they're delivering overbearingly boring material there are some scenes that have tension but as i said before it's the final operation scene that brings it all together the acting is great jessica_chastain does a fantastic job as she usually does and everyone around her does an equally fantastic job even mark strong who is a typically great actor but has been given a horrible american accent to match his equally horrible hair piece on the technical side of things the film is pieced together nicely but i had issues with the actual filming there was no need for the entire film to be shot with a shaky_cam i understand the idea is to immerse the viewer but it has become exceptionally irritating over the years over all i'm a little unsure what all the hype was about this just wasn't all that interesting to me.one of the best movies for 2013 best movie i've_seen in two years.amazing movie the development of maya the mystery the suspense and the buildup of the final scene all came together i did not want to leave my_seat to go to the washroom.well i hope some of you really like films about the cia and their long investigating processes otherwise you're probably not gonna like the hurt_locker director kathryn_bigelow's latest film zero_dark thirty most of this picture isn't even devoted to the mission in which america went after one of the most_wanted men in the world osama_bin laden it's more devoted to the person who tried to track down the whereabouts of the al_qaeda members in hopes of obtaining information on the man most responsible for the september_11 attacks while there are some aspects to respect about this picture there are also some annoying aspects as well after a pointless opening with no visuals and only audio of a phone call on september_11 to start us off we follow newly appointed cia officer maya jessica_chastain who was apparently recruited straight out of high school as she accompanies fellow cia officer dan jason_clarke in interrogating someone with links to al_qaeda members close to osama_bin laden from there maya progresses from a newcomer to a professional investigator as she tries to get closer to finding the whereabouts of this public enemy so we can finally do what we've sought out to do for 10 years avenge the 9_11 attacks there's no use asking me whether or not i think everything in the film is based_on fact since i couldn't understand what was going on 50 of the time but more on that later one of the things i like about this movie is jessica_chastain's character since she does actually have some underlying warmth and likability to her after seeing homeland i've been skeptical regarding whether or not i'd like cia female characters anymore but with zero_dark thirty i was able to identify with the protagonist in terms of what she was going through and most importantly i actually cared what_happened to her so i guess that has to count for something doesn't it i also thought the film's final act was very good and was the point when i really started to become interested in what was happening that's partly because i knew something big was going to result from this and despite my knowledge of the result of the climax through the news and 60 minutes in real_life the film brings the excitement of that event to life through some superb documentary style filming techniques we're truly taken along for the ride as the military comes ever closer towards finally claiming their much desired prize which they've been searching for a decade_long but for these two major positive aspects of the picture you do have to pay a certain price to get to them don't you that price being the actual investigating process for a film that runs a little more than two and a half hours this big chunk of the picture feels way too_long i think this part of the film would have_been much better if the storytelling was more direct and less broad and if the dialogue sounded like conversations normal people have instead of authentic cia dialogue that's too smart for its own good to the point that it's practically a foreign language to be fair though i know it's not easy trying to tell a true real_life story of this nature and i realize they're trying to recreate the story as realistically as possible so that it resembles a documentary i also realize that it was not easy finding and interrogating these enemies in reality and that they want to capture just how frustrating the process is if you don't mind this certain storytelling approach and admire its authenticity that's fine all i'm saying is it's just not what i call cinematic entertainment since it's too exhausting to keep up with and follow from what i've said in this review so far you'd think i might dislike zero_dark thirty i actually think zero_dark thirty is okay it's certainly better_than most films of its genre largely because its such an important story in american history and kathryn_bigelow wisely treats and tells the story with the utmost maturity and seriousness also the film was wise enough to make the main female character a likable person even_though she is put under very pressing circumstances and that's rare for a genre like this to do overall there's enough here for me to give zero_dark thirty a pass just know what to expect and don't set your expectations too high.how obl was captured told in the american way.i admit that i was a little distracted while watching this movie so i wasn't paying the plot the attention it deserved but i still thought it was fantastic i only wish i would have gotten a little more story on jessica_chastain's character so i could understand where she was coming from outside of work or at_least before she started the job it was hard to relate to her when i knew nothing about her apart from her obsession with catching bin laden.although an excellent film i also found zero_dark thirty to be very disturbing in the way that it depicted the cia torture of prisoners in such a matter of fact manner as an historian i've learned to look at both_sides of a question and it moral implications if the end justifies the means how does that make one side any different from the other very good film i love the way the events running up to the bin_laden mission were directed would definitely recommend it.one movie that is one that is on the right track to take down a rude mean man was ok didnt really get into it until the middle and endi do not have to sing the praises of this awarded film for it to be well known as the amazing cinematic masterpiece that it is never before have i seen such a thorough inside look at a dark political process as counterterrorism and felt so enriched for having watched it.n\\xc3\\xa3o estava a contar ser t\\xc3\\xa3o agradavelmente surpreendida com este filme bom elenco boa hist\\xc3\\xb3ria boa imagem.a masterpiece i don't think i could watch again.don't really know what to say other than it has the guy from argo in it kyle_chandler stannis baratheon and cpt jack harkness at some point it's a good film a bit long for me had some powerful moments in it and jessica_chastain did a great job in this role i did like argo more also from the whole terrorist hunt point of view i prefer munich and body of lies to this one here good film though definitely worth watching.it was ok but boring most of the time the ending was okaywhile it would always be fascinating subject_matter bigelow ensures the audience are given a fair and accurate account of the painstaking intelligence operation to track down ubl the culmination is a thrilling finale that raises so many moral dilemmas and provides no easy answers thoughtful exhilarating and absolutely relevant.the story of how the seals finally got osama_bin laden.i liked this movie good suspense the torture scenes were gripping definitely better_than average worth_watching for sure.yes i daresay this was even better_than the hurt_locker which itself was a fantastic film.actually i was incredibly surprised how much i loved this movie i was expecting it to be a movie full of extreme detail and very difficult to follow because of that at the beginning of the movie that is very much the case just too many names and aliases being thrown around and without knowing the intelligene details it gets tricky to follow but the last hour or so of the movie makes it all worth while even_though you know exactly how it will end the intensity at that point of the movie is incredible i definitely recommend this movie the oscar committee probably had a tough time deciding between this movie and the winner of best picture.loved it enough said would watch it over and over again not terrible but its way too soon for this movie to exist and the fact that they play real 9_11 victim phone calls at the beginning is just insenstive and indefensiblegreat great great filmkiller and awesome moviei got one thing out of this movie when kidnapping and isolating someone for extended periods you can tell them anything see united_states media and upcoming changes to passport laws.exciting gripping amazing 4 jeremy rennersgreat story w very solid acting from all parties loved this movie not a documentary or a movie just somewhere in between that fails to ultimately be good at either leaving you with a feeling afterwards that you have not been entertained or moved in any way instead you have simply observed events hmmmm disappointedanother bigelow masterpiece and though the piece portrays torture in a way that is uncomfortable to me it is technically taut and boasts of great performances all around a half a star less because it is marginally not as good as hurt_locker comparisons to argo are unfair because both films strive for different affects i think i just liked the affect of hurt_locker more than zdt.not the greatest acting but a decent moviea very well made and suspenseful movie with a great amount of payoff at the end.zd30 is a film that is not for everyone some may love it and some may find it long boring but i found this film to be a good movie with great acting its a great attempt to push 10 years of america hunting bin_laden into a 2h30m film the film's highlight is jessica charstain acting 2012 2013 s best biographical drama film.if you can sit through all the confusing talky babble and toss you'll be rewarded with a slightly above average movie.a slow burner that builds into quite a gripping spy thriller and that cast the first kathryn_bigelow's movie i watched was hurt_locker and i love it when kathryn's zero_dark thirty is available at video ezy i was hoping it would be as good as hurt locker.nearly half of zero_dark thirty portrays how cia interrogate prisoners who are attached to al_qaeda as it portrays all the fine details of the interrogate and torture it make me feel the movie is more a documentary than a drama tom charity of cnn criticizes director bigelow has never shield away from violence or the vicarious pleasure.in the movie those prisoners are willing to speaks out informations needed cia the movie seems to be justified that in order to defend the united stated of america interrogate and torture towards prisoners who are attached to al_qaeda are needed.if you are a fan of waterboarding violence torture and interrogations this is a movie for you unfortunately in my humble opinion zero_dark thirty is not hurt_locker an academy awarded action movie packed with good action scenes and good dramas.a bit slow at_times but with an awesome ending.watched in theaters 2 1 2013this movie defines a generation one the history books will never forget a reminder of how 9_11 2001 has forever changed everything in the world we live in.the work up to the final scene at the compound in pakistan is a lesson in building tension at atmosphere in cinema an all around awesome flick.thought this film was not gripping suspenseful nor brilliantly crafted not because i already knew how it ends but it just wasn't a great film i largely believe this is about a bunch of mainly american reviewers slapping each_other on the back congratulating each_other about the frank and hard hitting way that the hunt for osama_bin laden has been portrayed on film it's self congratulatory bullshit that attempts to be hard hitting but ends up becoming nothing more than trite crap that drags on for far too_long kind of like this review.this was a good one but i'm not sure it deserved all that oscar hype chastain owned her role that's for sure and maybe i'm a schmuck for wanting to be more entertained by a film based_on such a dark gritty time in our nation's history i don't_know spoiler alert when she unzipped the body bag i so wanted to hear her say got you fuddermukker kathryn_bigelow fails to create any sort of relatable connection to the main_character i didn't care at all if she lived or died the irritating text on screen describing where and when they were got old and disorienting really fast to make this movie even worse the ending scene wasn't accurate to how the real mission actually happened.so boring you will never want to see a war film again it may or may not be what_happened and how but it just drags and drags and drags.a poor plot with plane characters swinging aimlessly between a documentary about the long way to get bin_laden and a lame drama about maya the cia_agent dedicated for this task and the only significant character in the movie the result is a boring movie with no dramatic structure jessica_chastain's great performance and kathryn_bigelow's technical direction tried to give some spirit to the movie but apparently in vain.great story but average movie.slow but fascinating you definitely feel the drawn out hopelessness as it took 10 years to find osama and the hesitation once their was a lead then the hope and excitement once the decision was made to move the drivenness of just one person really can make a difference if you lie to me i'll hurt you this movie was so beautifully made and despite what the award shows may have you believe this was the best film of 2012 with that being said jessica chastin was simply wonderful with portraying her character and while she was definitely one of my favorites my absolute favorite was jason_clarke he added that spice and his acting was spot on as well one of the best movies_i've seen in awhileso far the reviews are all positive.not that exciting if you already_know what happens this dramatized movie of the hunt and death of osama_bin laden is worth see in your lifetime.i tried to watch brutal.one if the best i saw yet.definitely a well directed movie and one that prides itself on how smart it is unfortunately for me because of focus on getting all the details right of this true_story the characters seemed to get lost it seemed like a story of just facts in an investigation instead of a mystery or crusade that we were tagging along for maybe that's just me unfairly wanting a hollywood version of this but it's only in the last act that the story really becomes gripping great performances all around even_though it seemed the actors were only there for a couple scenes.zero dark_thirty is the dramatic re telling of the hunt and killing of osama_bin laden i wish i had not waited so long to see it this should have_been seen on the big screen in a movie theater however this film is amazing jessica_chastain plays maya the cia_agent maya she was recruited right after 9_11 and has only worked on finding bin_laden actually she is obsessed with him she witnesses torture of al_qaeda agents in cia black sites and eventually confirms that the body brought back to the camp in afghanistan is bin_laden the film is very detailed and seems very authentic it was very emotional to watch and was chock full of action i enjoyed it immensely.zero dark_thirty may be slow but its an effective thriller with good performances and an incredible third_act while constantly being interesting.not my cup of tea shout out to jason clark tho he's the homiecan you spell propaganda a good cast and really suspenseful moments and a interesting look at the greatest_manhunt in history love how one woman has worked for cia but one project find osama_bin laden and kill him.after the utter awfulness of the hurt_locker i watched this to see if it could be as bad and was surprised that it does actually have a plot and is enjoyable you care about the main_character and follow her obsession to the ending that you already_know well_done this time kathryn very intense and extremely well_acted especially by jessica_chastain and jennifer_ehle who's a real standout brilliantly directed by kathryn_bigelow and well worth the time to watch.this movie made me hate jessica chastisin she's really annoying in thisi can't wait to get a look at this brutal unsparing look at the ten year hunt to capture osama_bin ladena fascinating and uncompromising in particular with regard to u.s torture of detainees film about the hunt for osama_bin laden brilliantly acted and directed with sensitivity and realism spoilers i don't_know what i was expecting exactly but i was slightly let down by this movie granted it was intense and the final raid on the compound to get bin_laden was wonderfully done but i got bored for the first hour until the suicide bombing with the doctor still an interesting watch gotta admit i was getting pretty pissed off with the fact it took over 120 days for any action once the compound was found the marker on the window scenes were nicely punctuated.great movie these_guys are hero's a must_see for everyone.would have given the movie four stars but importatnt parts of the movie were just too dark to see dvd library like the actual hunt for bin_laden it starts slow and doesn't seem to go anywhere then it picks up and ends in success it's both a political thriller and a girl power tale.this was a good film a very nice build_up with a lot of different aspects the climax was worth the wait but obviously predictable worth a watch if you have the time.a great well rounded film suspenseful and you always had a sense of wanting jessica_chastain's character to accomplish her goal because she had invested her entire career in one mission.zero dark_thirty is a gritty effective and gripping thriller all centered around the greatest_manhunt in history in search of osama_bin laden the majority of the film is very detail oriented and dialogue heavy but is supported very well by jessica_chastain's excellent performance the final act is suspenseful and is a huge payoff for the first 2 hours spent paying attention to all the knitty gritty detail.although what good did killing bin_laden do if the us is going to stay in afghanistan until 2024 or some ridiculous date like that started slow but got betterbrilliant and thrilling filmmaking this film is as steely and laser focused as chastain's protagonist the film brilliantly wraps the audience up in the hunt for bin_laden and then has the balls to question just what his capture and execution really meant bigelow just keeps getting better and better as a filmmaker and jessica_chastain in just two short years has staked a claim to being finest actress of this generation one of the year's best a very fascinating look at what really happened the night osama died with an incredible performance from jessica chastain.while the beginning appears to play out in real time things move into gear for the second_half and there are solid performances particularly from chastainalthough it had interesting scenes in it some of which had me sitting on the edge of my_seat in shock it feels unbalanced between suspense and slow paced dialogue scenes.i'm giving it three stars but i'm not comfortable with it.depressing as hell boring too.quality ish chk it out and you'll b glad you did girl knows how to direct.there are very intense scenes in zero_dark thirty but there is also very slow scenes nothing in the middle to balance them out.awesome that is all.boring propaganda movie that has a bit of action in the end that makes it fun but the rest is pretty boring.zero dark_thirty doesn't quite live up to the hype it is compelling for the most part but inevitable there is a air of anti climax about the final act this was unavoidable and perhaps is an indication that hollywood should wait a bit longer before making films about recent history.the film lives up to its oscar winning status but also fits into the category of overly praised films as well.gripping thriller even_though you know the plot.it's been a while since i've_seen this one but it didn't really stick it was ok though.zero dark_thirty is technically impressive the screenwriting and direction are top_notch suspenseful and gratifying even_though it's extremely serious and rather impersonal nonetheless the saving grace here is the stellar jessica_chastain who brought one of the most fearless yet fragile powerful yet human leading ladies i've_ever seen to life and the best part is the film is just as fantastic as she is.the final hour is some of the most captivating engrossing and impeccably directed cinema i've_seen in years it's just a shame the first_half of the film is so pedestrian and quite frankly dull.already having a keen interest in the subject of the film it was everything i expected and a bit more the tension and intrigue grips you from the very beginning thus you never really notice the long running_time definitely bigelow's best film to date.muito bom a jessica_chastain merecia o \\xc3\\xb3scar mil vezes mais que a jennifer lawrence d\\xc3\\xa1 se o desconto do sensacionalismo e parcialismo americano mas mesmo assim muito bem feito i really enjoyed the acting the editing and the cinematography but the story itself how can i be proud of what humans do specially this stuffs i'm not proud of this killing i'm not happy of this movie and the ones who work on it are mad as a hatter sorry but 3 stars of 5 humans please evolve and stop enjoying the absurd september 4 2013 review not your typical war flick but still awesome a real behind the scenes about how terrorist are hunted well worth the rentthere is a maruthi suzuki swift dzire car in pakistan i think only an indian can make it out great movie very interesting how that all played outa true thriller.after the 9_11 terror attack in 2001 osama_bin laden had been named most_wanted by the cia in the course of the next decade intelligence analyst maya jessica_chastain attempts to track down a courier who she believes to be bin_laden's right hand man a man who could possibly lead the cia to their goal in 2011 maya believes she has not only found the courier but also bin_laden bigelow and boal have again team up after the brilliant modern day war epic the hurt_locker and have presented us with the story of history's greatest_manhunt for the world's most_dangerous man as it has been dubbed however in parts i feel the film is over dramatized in particular jessica_chastain's character maya although chastain yet again gives a tremendous performance at_times the character is just overly dramatic and unbelievable before the death of bin_laden in may 2011 bigelow and boal were working on a film which would highlight the struggle that the us have faced in their attempt to capture the founder of al_qaeda once his death was announced they soon realised they needed to start again and as such have a central figure maya is presented at the start of the film fairly tame and quiet yet as the film progresses she quickly develops into the grand heroine who hounds her superiors in order to keep the hunt for bin_laden alive when nobody else seems to care the tipping point of complete farcical dramatization was during maya's face to face meeting with white house aide james_gandolfini who she needs on her side in order to be able to act on her intel of bin_laden's whereabouts when asked who she was by gandolfini she replies i'm the mother f er who found this place sir get real believe it or not these horribly cring worthy parts of the script didn't too badly effect the performance given by chastain at_times her ruthlessness in the face of her superiors maintained the pace in the story making a two and a half_hour film fly by i further respect bigelow for her depiction of torture following the 9_11 attacks instead of covering up any immoral act from us officials bigelow confronted them head on something which has since caused some controversy in the us especially with those namely naomi wolf who feel that torture should always be depicted as ineffective and immoral for me zero_dark thirty is only worthy of its oscar nominations due to the final third of the film the operation put in place on the fortress as mark duplass character calls it where bin_laden is hiding out is a superb and thrilling piece of film making tensions are visibly high in one shot the heavy breathing of one of the navy_seals is highlighted although a small touch by the director it all adds to the gripping nature of the final scenes in the film.zero dark_thirty definitely simplifies the operation that was put in place to capture and kill osama_bin laden but for the most part it works j.henderson 7 10 awesome awesome movie.bigelow knocks it out of the park with a film so tense i'm still reeling from the incredible final sequence.director kathryn_bigelow once_again successfully caught the critics attention with another movie about middle_east and this time about the hunting of most_wanted criminal osama_bin laden as same as the first movie who successfully raised jeremy renner's popularity jessica_chastain got the attention for playing a strong willed woman to caught the most_wanted criminal on earth golden globe and some other awards are the mark of her success for playing the character maya jumps right in with the detainee torture.disturbing torture scenes makes you think in my name the movie gives a great insight into what it took to find and eliminate osama and how many years of work the american intelligence devoted to what for an average person was a piece of everyday news the movie however could be more dynamic as it tends to be slow for most of the time and speeds up only close to the end and the big action.great film they should make more like this onegood movie another historical feature for best pic jessica_chastain should have won best lead actress any other year and this movie would have won best picture but argo has to take the cake great performance and movie overall though.elegant and brillantly one of the best films of kathryn with a strong script and fill the spectatives as potent film of 2012i gotta admit that movie was pretty intense i really liked how they showed you different sides of the search and how difficult it was to get anywhere with all the political b.s involved the best scenes were with clarke chastain dan maya and of course the bin_laden compound raid now with all that said i do feel like the movie didn't need to be that damn long i think also that if not for this being about a real_life situation and it being so personal to every american that i probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much but considering we can't undo the past this movie was worth seeing i wouldn't suggest going to a late show only because it's almost 3 hours long but it's worth the late show price as always i hope i helped not as good as the hurt_locker but it is still extremely good.ugh terrible slow boring zero driven garbage i kept looking at the clock wondering when it was going to get better and it never did i was amazed at the media attention and positive reviews it received absolutely amazed total garbage.zero dark_thirty is quite the remarkable movie in any number of ways it's highly controversial but grounds itself in an almost frighteningly real authenticity that must be seen to be believed the film's ability to captivate its audience and maintain a steady rhythm even with an extended runtime and a foreknowledge of even some of the secondary story items is truly remarkable bigelow's craftsmanship is so good it seems almost beyond the limits of the medium she captures an essence an authenticity an attention to detail a grittiness a reality that's incredibly difficult to achieve in film and she does so by telling a story everybody knows but few really know and even fewer truly understand the film is a technical masterpiece and very well performed to boot it oozes a realism that's rare in cinema and with that realism comes understandably difficult themes that have generated controversy but that are absolutely necessary to the contextual foundation of the story and critical in recreating as authentic a history as possible this is a brilliant film in every regard that no matter one's stance on the many arguments around it is well worth the price of admission and then some.very well_acted and enthralling for the most part but there are painfully sluggish bits that seem to be drawn out just for the sake of being drawn out.good movie shows real world strategy to real world crime don't watch if you are quick to judgement and think the world is black and white.ahh so that's what water_boarding is.apparently this film is extremely accurate to the actual_events that makes it a good history lesson and a good watch for anyone.excellent movie part political thriller and part military movie this beast of a film is one of the best i have seen in a while the script is great the acting is superb and it is pretty evenly paced with lot of tension and moments where you might want to pause just to breath i highly_recommend this film 9 10makes you proud to be american shows hardships from all perspectives.amazing movie each actor held their roles and i feel did a flawless performance this movie kept_me interested and it is filled with bit dialogue and plenty of action this movie is good enough to own on blu ray here it is my most anticipated film of 2012 it could have gone one or two ways and it unfortunately went south it's not a bad film by any means but it's not a particularly outstanding one either a little too procedural and emotionally inept the less talented cousin of 2009 s the hurt_locker chastain is magnificent of course outside of that cringe worthy scene she has with kyle_chandler but i was left a little cold and disappointed.good just good recomended fantastic i watched the film in 3 hour stints over 3 days the first two hours are like a brilliant and fast_paced which portrays the threat and urgency aswell as tension.the best movie i've_seen in years the problem was is to real and most people don't like to see the truth about what bin_laden was really doing and what we did to stop him.this movie runs down the events of america finally finding osama and killing him it is a very interesting movie but comes off more like a documentary you have to have the time to get through this one once you're into it you're invested in the ending gritty performances makes you realize how much luck and circumstance went into the assassination of the biggest terrorist of all time worth the money if you have the time.lets forget about actual_events for a bit and treat this as a film the first problem it has is that even_though it's inconceivable that anyone in the world today doesn't know what the 9_11 was or who bin_laden was you still can't assume people walk into a film knowing its background this film does.the film is extremely long and boring and a lot of it could've been left in the cutting floor we don't need half an hour of torture especially if you're going to do it twice just to show how your character learnt to do it i have nothing to comment on the morality of it since i'm coming from a film review and not an historical analysis but one thing is that the film finds it necessary even if no real important info was gained by using it another different thing is to enjoy it.the lead actress is not good the only scene i felt i was watching a true person was the last one but that doesn't matter anyway since the character she got to play is a deranged woman obsessed with a lead everyone thinks is worthless who just gets lucky when her hunch proves to be true again i don't_know if that's close to what happen in real_life but in the film there's no real reason for anyone to take her and her obsession seriously if she had any accomplishment before getting bin_laden the film just skips that even mcclane had to prove he wasn't a nut before anyone in the nakatomi plaza incident took him seriously.then there's the structure the film is divided in episodes but then within the episodes each scene looks like a different chapter so it lacks smoothness and uniformity some parts even look like a string of snl sketches only you know not funny being a good researcher is not enough you can do a documentary and be done with it but if you're going to dramatize the events i think it's better if you treat it like any other film set up the events show the conflict and give it resolution don't just take the events and splice them together.very disappointed with this film.awesome job capturing non bias point of view takes a while to get going and it sags in the middle but the last hour is compelling.taut drama well directed.not as good as the hurt_locker but it does in fact come pretty close it is graphic and disturbing in a lot more than half the movie but if you can fight to get past that it really is a spectacular movie and my_favorite thing is the acting of jason_clarke and jessica_chastain they're unbelievability amazing and the plot and all the scenes you don't see comming and are heart racing to the bitter endthe best film of 2012 by fara solid 4 stars there is no shying away from the issues here and the last 10 minutes rival that of luke saving vader if your a true american drenched with emotion and drama tossing politics aside this is a great effort better_than the hurt_locker probably in thanks to jessica_chastain's steely loveably stubborn heroine maya she is passionate about her objective even obsessive there is one scene where she hollers at her superior for not taking her mission seriously enough and i had to rewind it because it was showcased chastain's tremendous talent and range as an actress i've never seen her do that in a role before and it was awesome the movie is suspenseful and gripping you're glued to your spot throughout this near 3 hour film the acting is also amazing i agree with a reviewer's assessment that the killing of osama_bin laden marked the end of an era in america i had only heard of the man right after 9_11 and the interest in him seemed to wane for the most part in the years to follow in fact he was out of the public eye conscience for years and then all of a sudden there's a special report on one not so very special sunday evening while i wasn't among the ones tackily cheering usa usa as if this were a world cup match i certainly wasn't among the crowd bemoaning bin_laden's human rights after all some people had no problem running in the streets and cheering exuberantly after 3,000 innocent civilians perished in cold blood at the behest of this particular person the man was a pox on humanity a cancer that had no choice but to be removed but i really think this movie is neutral when it comes to taking any sort of stance or making a statement either way it's just telling a story point blank.while zero_dark thirty isn't celebratory by any means it's worth noting the lack of hugging smiling cheering or general look of pure satisfaction from maya herself in a way i do think it honors the tenacity of one woman who spent a decade of her life chasing after one man ten years is a long long time to keep dogging a case where so many around you doubt your theories and sanity a terrific movie that i highly recommend.torture for 157 minutes do you have to be an american to enjoy this loved it great moviemuch better_than i expected well_done great performances all around will watch again plus the foley and sfx were superb great movie very suspenseful great detail

find disturbing one cannot help but think that if they had actually gone after bin_laden instead of invading iraq maybe the world would be a safer place 10acting 8.5writing 8.5dialogue 9plot characterization 9cinematography editing 9soundtrack score set design 9how much i enjoyed it personally 9this is nowhere near as good as people say it is kathryn_bigelow once_again takes herself to the oscars with another over long and story less snooze fest there are moments of great suspense and jessica_chastain is one hell of an actress too bad i could not care about this movie in any way whatsoever yawn good movie although ugly.compare the opening of this propaganda piece to that of argo the latter lays out a balanced and objective historical context for the underlying causes of the iranian hostage crisis the former fails to do so instead we're treated to audio of emergency calls from dying 9_11 victims nevermind all that messy cia involvement with bin_laden in the 80s or the million other ways the agency is responsible for so called blowback who are we supposed to be rooting for here the cold blooded international terrorists or the cold blooded international terrorists i didn't enjoy it her acting is too over the top doesn't seem realistic the dialouge is terrible excellent movie kathryn_bigelow is becoming a master slow pace but i think that added to the realism very good but thinking this is not the kind of movie i would want to see again.update to review just watched it again feel the same pense que iba a ver mas accionone of my all time favorite films unique combination of boredom bad movie making and tastelessnessdark intense and gritty the hunt for ubl is depicted in fine detail with strong performances from the major characters personally i don't really like the film but it managed to keep me at the edge of my_seat throughout the whole 150 minutes so i can't say that i'm not impressed with the tension in the plot.i just loved maya and i think jessica_chastain was simply amazing as her the whole film built up the tension beautifully and i really enjoyed it.the last hour of this movie is among the most thrilling in movie history in my_opinion that being said they probably could have cut out a solid half_hour at_least out of the beginning of the movie i almost turned it off.bigelow sucks when it comes to drama but when it turns to action bigelow shines you know the outcome of the events this movie is based_on but you still find yourself compelled with the plot unfolding.acting is superb so much so i didn't notice some of the more popular actors since they immersed themselves in their roles.this movie is an absolute rent just be patient through the beginning.great movie with sharp and detailed performances shame the ending didn't achieve the emotional impact it should have.it's certainly an important film to watch because of its bared content i'm still discussing with myself whether i believe the events to be true or if the entire script was a clever way to humbly beat the american chest regardless the film is incredibly well_done there were several prominent actors that i would have preferred not been cast simply for the sake of the realism you get with non hollywood faces however such choices certainly don't detract from an impeccably laid out plot i could have done without several scene choices for the sake of cutting screen time down to less that 2hrs 30 mins chastain did a fantastic job as did all of the portrayals there is a striking difference between the schwarzenegger willis action flicks and the responsibly efficient military movie that was oscar worthy in 2012 i'm a little late on this one as i saw it in the theater just after release i'm not going to write much since everyone i know has seen it.liberal take on the takedown of ubl no payoff in the climactic scene of the film all smoke and mirrors overall i was incredibly disappointed the discovery channel special was better.great based_on true_story movie.very good movie considering you know exact all how it ends before you watch it keeps you glued to the scene the whilea crap of a brainwashit was a good documentary like movie but it wasn't all that catchy for me i'm more of a tragic story person so 9_11 movies are more appealing to me this however was somewhat exciting and interesting.zero dark_thirty was a truly great in some unique aspects but not ground breaking in the way that the hurt_locker captured and embedded the nature and grit shots that infused the mind those horrors captured with not as radiant cinematography as the directors previous attempt but zero_dark thirty is a great movie nonetheless and worth seeing.it was good i believe it's better_than the hurt locker.int\\xc3\\xa9ressant mais

\\xc3\\xa0 suivre.first we have to be thankful that it was not michael_bay who made the hunt for bin_laden fortunately this is no triumphant yahoo i'm usually averse to anything over 96 minutes but this had me hooked for the duration especially impressive when you do wonder whether its going to be 157 minutes of water_boarding at one stage.there are definite parallels to homeland s01 and its very good at getting your buy in the 9_11 phone call at the beginning is incredibly moving and you will flinch when the 7 7 bomb goes off the torture scenes are harrowing but give you time to contemplate your own opinions indeed agonies are inflicted on both_sides and maya is fleshed out as a character after one atrocity.the conclusion is stunning when the camera pulls away to first reveal the compound you feel like you've stumbled across the bates motel the operation is incredibly tense but handled in exactly the right way a grown up excellent film.the tactician did very welldidn't think the movie should ever been madeit reminded me of lincoln it was an interesting topic done in a boring way.the only bloody thirsty murderous zealots in this movies are the cia.one of my monday night pics if you haven't_seen zero_dark thirty it's a must_see jessica_chastain was wonderful in her portrayal enjoyed the action and suspense.very interesting would recommend if you like films like jarhead and the hurt_locker 4 5_stars based in the true events leading to the killing of osama_bin laden this film shows us the endeavours of the young intelligence officer that found him maya for a few years she followed every single lead until she managed to locate the very secretive residence of the terrorist leader but then she had to convince her superiors to act on it lots of information is thrown at us in what it looks as a very well researched piece of cinema but while it is a reasonable approximation it is not entirely accurate all sort of clues witness accounts and telephone numbers are extracted mostly through torture the first part of the movie is all about water_boarding sleep deprivation beatings and physical and mental abuse not very easy to watch if you consider that that sort of interrogation technique happened regularly in real_life the second part is more about the developments of the investigation telephone taping and following of suspects the very last half_hour is the siege of the osama_bin laden's compound by a special operations team it is an interesting movie that sheds some light into the working system of the cia and the complexities of the corridors of power in washington however some scenes are really harsh and the overall idea that the end justifies the means is too medieval for me i am not entirely comfortable either with the message of the film there's no other course of action but executing this individual there are always democratic options maybe less popular but fairer in my view.nitty gritty film faced on facts about finding bin_laden and what the americans tried to achieve in finding him good political film definitely worth watching.an edge of your_seat thriller no matter what we all know how this ends but bigelow drags us in for a thrill ride that hangs by a needle perfect filmmaking from start to finish.it's a long movie seemed to drag on a little bit at parts but the content is good and its based_on actual_events good acting and very realistic settings kathryn_bigelow's zero_dark thirty is a grueling masterpiece that captures the hunt for bin_laden with a daunting amount of realism and efficiency it's also about a woman infiltrating a male dominated culture and controversial enhanced interrogation methods great supporting_cast of strong gandolfini pratt clarke and duplass.a very dull film thats deceives its audince by claiming its a true_story when infact most of the characters and events are highly fictionalized some of the worst pacing on screen in recent years.casi como un documental buena could have_been betterdidn't care for the other bigelow movies_i've seen and didn't expect to like this one either now i might have to give hurt_locker a chance after all.outstanding film great proformancewhat a great gripping movie blatant pro torture propagandaa well reviewed strongly performed movie based off the killing of one of the most fearsome terrorists in history bigelow returns again with a film that is a behemoth of controversy a surplus of technical detail and suspense creates a masterpiece the manhunt is well chronicled and true phenomenal craftsmanship.interesting from an historical viewpoint but overall this film was not to my liking perhaps because i am not american and couldn't really connect to it at a personal level.bigelow at her very best which is dreadful appalling cast who supposedly represent americas finest intelligence and interrogation teams next time they want someone to break just show them one of bigelows films the cameron influence is still as subtle as a dancing brontosaurus.a very chilling movie it gets it point across very well and shows a side to the history we have_been a part of that many people did not know of.more accurate than one would like to think zero_dark thirty gets away with a lot it is a movie of time of pacing patience and unbeatable unbelievable tensions frills and other such bullshit don't even make it past the gate the movie opens flat out on a minutes long black screen beneath the sounds of screams sirens and eventually silence of audiotapes from september 11th 2001 jump two years later and there's our eyes and ears for the rest of the film in maya jessica_chastain a cia officer sent to the u.s embassy in pakistan to work with someone whose mission right then is to squeeze information from a captive with potential ties to a saudi terrorist system we're with maya in exciting a nerve of discomfort when her compatriot feels necessary to strip him down soiled pants and all before being choked into a dog collar and led to cramp inside a small wooden box but in zero_dark thirty even the most gruesome torture tactics aren't lost on any one individual fighting for or against god and country he's all our prisoner in the war on terror's if you're not with us you're against us philosophy and any lead is proof enough it's worth it to reap what we sow good and bad zero_dark was written and directed by mark_boal and kathryn_bigelow respectively both of whose hurt_locker took home six oscars in 2010 including best picture over the biggest movie in the world at the time and of all time james cameron's avatar from 2003 to 2005 maya's confidence and beleaguered obsession grows roots in scrambling to connect alien suspects to who's predicted to be osama_bin laden's go to courier from wherever he's hiding out i don't want to spoil too much only to say boal's script spans major attacks disasters and all sorts of bombings with impassioned nuance and each highlight if later revealed for partial clues also checkpoints and renews the maddening vertigo and impartial anxiety of the senses at the center of everything like i said at the beginning zero_dark thirty does get away with a lot half formed characters and relationships distracting cameos that's nit picking its heart of darkness is in the tireless maya chastain with whiz bang spunk the story's corners are testament to the hardship and ferocity of a case so big stopping or slowing down could permanently dismiss yet unexplained pieces as idyll fevers and mirrors zero_dark thirty is also strong evidence for bigelow's being a new master this is filmmaking with guts and rings valiant and magnificent that's also ultimately a character and do note dearly female driven piece concerning the morality and consequence of directive anger and retribution in the wake of raw public sentiment it's also a movie about a woman who dared bear the weight of fatal attraction her distress stirs true for all of us but especially to those to whom sacrifice can sometimes strike less as star crossed than forlorn.i do not understand the hype around this movie the film was uneventful for the most part there was practically no emotion an unintentional documentary esque movie.great thriller quietly gripping from start to finish.there's not much technically wrong with this film chastain gives an oscar worthy performance and it has a visual style all its own but i was just bored the film failed to get me invested in the hunt of osama_bin laden any more than any news segment would some of the characters feel more like wikipedia articles than real people if that makes any sense.wow amazing movie that brings the news to the bug screen in a believable film.when learning about this movie i was hapygreat film although i did find it rather slow at the start.great rendition of events jessica_chastain is fantastic just enough intrigue and action with the true_story shining through perfect.good movie a bit lengthy but intriguing and well directed.kathryn bigelow is undoubtedly a master filmmaker whose stunning formula of real_life events gritty realism and strong political commentary is a real winner her most memorable film is the hurt_locker and it's still an unforgettable and explosive movie that shows off her talent and the great thing about that movie is the speedy pace and devotion to characters but with zero_dark thirty it misses the mark and runs on a frustratingly slow pace that never gains momentum and it's characters aren't ones you'll remember even if the cast deliver realistic performances that feel like your actually sitting in a room with actual operatives that took part in these events to the build_up of finding and eliminating osama_bin laden there is zero emotion or impact in this movie and it's surprisingly uneventful that's my main criticism but this isn't a bad film it's shot very well and there are many moments of shock and awe but i won't be watching this again i just wish it had flown faster and kept_me gripped 2.5 hours of grit and obsession bundled together in the hunt for bin_laden superb and compelling film.good but not that greatgood but not that greatboring and approve brutality methodologies us use how they treat prisoners and how they kill all ben laden family i know this movie is very polarizing but as a movie it's really well made well_acted awesome direction same director from pointbreak it's definitely a hollywood version of what probably happened but still worth seeing and i don't think the depiction of torture is as black and white as some of the criticism has said it's complicated sure but not an all out endorsement as far as i can see.still couldn't figure it out about oscar nomination this movie included it is thrilling strong action movie but umm for oscar nominee just didn't get itanother slam dunk draction movie from bigelow.would have_been better with shemp howard as obama i am sure the film succeed in what it tried to do but what it tried to do was follow a very standard story arc heavy on suspense and extreme emotion low on feeling.a compelling engrossing and enthralling look at one of the cia's biggest undercover operations ever zero_dark thirty features a sharp cast with a another winning turn from the beautifully subtle jessica_chastain and utilising the facts of the true_story as well as an experienced director and great script certainly worth the oscar it nearly won.acad\\xc3\\xa9mique d\\xc3\\xa9monstratif et mal construit on a fait bien mieux avantone of my top ten very nicei like that the us doesn't come off too clean in this national security is a complex slow costly business and this film feels honest about that i was impressed because i figured this film would make an easy platform for a flat portrayal that would still rake in attention and praise i love how little of the script gives us blatant updates on the main character's thoughts her development is more subtle between trying to decide what she is thinking her next move and the action this movie holds the suspense very well jessica_chastain is excellent and i've never seen kyle_chandler command such attention the whole film exceeded my expectations.just watched a movie from last year's multiple oscar nomination zero_dark thirty its based_on the biggest manhunt in history of mankind of bin_laden what a movie absolutely stunning it's informative thrilling chilling the director kathyryn bigelow really nails it again after her movie hurt_locker jessica_chastain stands out and alone this movie belongs to her and ber only tour de force the events happening are so engrossing that u will be glued great movie must must must watch not to be missed you have to see it for yourself.i am in love with this movie it's really intense but extremely well done.very boring movie would never watch againslow moving but overall good moviethere is a lot i liked about this movie but i can't_help but think the director combined with the actors actresses are what hurt this film i know there was a lot of information to process over a period of several years but i was bored silly i absolutely love military films so even my bias towards them didn't help not everything needs to have a movie made about it history channel among others of course has shown some great made for tv dramas based_on true events.after the impressive and award winning the hurt_locker 2008 kathryn_bigelow returns to middle_east tensions in this drama based_on the ten year struggle to find the perpetrators of 9_11 their biggest goal is to capture or kill osama usama bin_laden himself and after many years a courier is found to be delivering more than just food to a secure compound in pakistan taking us through all the major events the film is a solid thriller with good acting and an amazing final_30 minutes as the us take the compound in the dead of night the film takes a while to get going and not for one instant did this reviewer see the film as pro torture the characters get gobbledegook from the detainees by using it and the perpetrators are shown to be repulsed by it the acting however is a bit middling chastain is always good but cameos from john barrowman and james_gandolfini couldn't help but think of his war mongering role within in the loop took me out of the film's otherwise consistent attempts at realism if you enjoy the subject_matter then the bin_laden shoot to kill documentary 2011 is a must_see follow up or if you're like me even more essential as they interview everyone from the head of the cia to president obama himself not the breath of fresh air that bigelow and writer mark boal's hurt_locker was the film still raises relevant questions about the war on terror and its participants abuse bigelow middle_east gigolo 8 10 midlands movies mikequite good but it could have_been better.riveting from start to finish a behind the scenes look at the politics and intrigue behind the manhuntnfornthe world most notorious terrorists.a very long movie it's good the hurt_locker was better.a beautifully photographed well_acted snooze fest.loved the acting and the intensity.just a steady build to the nail biting end wow would say it is one of my_favourite filmsit is kind of docudrama documentary drama one would think it would be extremely hard for kathryn_bigelow to recreate the success of the fantastic the hurt_locker but she pulls it off with zero_dark thirty a tense and courageous film that is absolutely worth of its critical acclaim.logic is not strong with this one.what it lacks in nothing it has in everything.kathryn bigelow established her skills with me after the hurt_locker with a masterful script from mark_boal and bigelows cinematic eye this film has all the thrills and sentiment to fully dramatize the manhunt for osama_bin laden.bigelow qui apparemment excelle dans le film de guerre psychologique nous offre le constat \\xc3\\xa9difiant de cette guerre moderne qu'est la lutte contre le terrorisme islamique c'est vraiment le jeu du j'te torture j'te fais exploser entre ces deux camps un jeu morbide qui n'augure pas d'une fin proche on suit donc la traque de ben laden des attentats du 11 septembre 2001 \\xc3\\xa0 sa mort en mai 2011 c'est super bien rythm\\xc3\\xa9 instructif document\\xc3\\xa9 et bien jou\\xc3\\xa9 a voir.i don't_know if i believe any of it but it felt realistic.i found this to be a bit boring it also could have_been a bit shorter.suspensful and very well constructed better_than argo for sure i guess we will never know how much if any of this is true if you assume that none is then it's a pretty good movie.one of the best features of this movie is the lack of sugarcoating solid performances good directing and editing we all know the ending but it is still riveting.one of the worst movies_i've seen in my entire life poorly edited acting was below average quality made an epic story boring and obscenely long.really good reminded me ia little of the film version of homeland im ashamed just as i am with the hurt_locker i was an army infantry sniper and this in no way depicts how we operate ive worked with sas seals sf rangers i was a tabbed ranger but not bat and cia its horrible that this recieved such high ratings especially at the end when they speak of the seal_team and i have nothing against seals ive worked with them and they are pretty savvy that they were alone on the raid there were 140 rangers standing by in two chinooks or shithooks as we call them just in case anything popped off i really hate the fact that this is the united_states depiction of what we do over all as a movie its pretty good but as a representation of the real operation im very unhappy.a true epic story of modern day heroes intriguing and intense but kinda long background about the events leading_up to the death of osama_bin laden.not loaded with the typical american flag waving and back slapping which was nice.i liked this more than bigelow's last movie the hurt_locker but it had slow moments at time jessica_chastain is always great and kyle_chandler gave a great performance as wellexcellent and to anyone criticizing the torture scenes you could see much worse in a gangster flick.not great but still one of the best war film kathryn_bigelow gives very strong directing.great film gripping zero_dark thirty is a dark thought_provoking and intense film that will hold you on the edge of your_seat even if it's outcome is predictable some slightly disturbing parts mainly the torture scenes at the start and the end assault long in the middle though made longer by the main_character clearly being a nutcase and annoying.what i liked the most about this movie is that it was unapologetic without playing the usual american tune of the rocky wins in the end theme you attack us we will hunt you down we will find you and you'll be shot down it doesn't make a cartoon of a horribly dark chapter of humanity and turn it into a us triumph storythis was a very intresting good film behind what was happenning and being done to hunt down and kill ubl but it still had very slow partsusing usama bin_laden as a subject was mysterious interesting but the movie's length is too_long enough that makes this manhunt a drama not action.its definitely slow burning at_times and even a bit boring but makes up for it in its directing and writing good solid film 7 10i see why this movie was nominated for best moviedon't know how laden didn't escape with all the noise they made coming invery suspenseful and great endingbest film i have seen in ages.zero dark_thirty is an absolute tour de forcezero dark_thirty is the true life story centred around the obsessive cia analyst who was most responsible for locating osama_bin laden katheryn bigelow's oscar winner is very much like a combination of her previous film the hurt_locker and the wire the bulk of the film is made up of cold war style spy duggery as telephones are tapped and suspects trailed to the door of america's most_wanted in fact she does not shy away from the dubious tactics employed by the us in extracting information from its persons of interest although one would have to say that although the film does not condone these actions it falls short of condemning them as well this information gathering section of the film can feel a little dry and over long because of the lack of human drama but it's all leading_up to a nail biting documentary style piece de resistance as we participate in the raid on bin_laden's compound in gripping detail which bigelow presents as little more than an execution than a fire fight i was dubious of the central character's emotional outburst at the close as if a woman were only capable of emotionally expressing herself through tears but it's a fascinating piece of recent history that is refreshing in its lack of gung ho us of a brand flag waving.excellent action movie throughout but a disappointing ending as it did just that end abruptly which is rather a shamenot bad but would not watchagainje l'ai regard\\xc3\\xa3 c \\xc3\\xa3 reculons au final les 2h40 passent sans qu'on s'en rende compte sans temps mort cela semble objectif sans \\xc3\\xa3\\xc2\\xaatre un film de propagande.i love movies like this that are based_on true events especially on the hunt for osama_bin laden the performances were great the lead performance by jessica_chastain was phenomenal.the movie seems to be pretty good of what i saw of it before i fell asleep it is a very slow movie but i don't think that i am going to try to finish it because i just couldn't stay into it it was a very monumental time for the usa so i see where and why it is loved by so many to see the capture and kill of osama_bin ladin but its just not really my thing.a tad overrated imo but still good.slow moving but still interesting patience is rewarded with a super climax.brilliant geronimo it has a healthy balance of chaos and order and triumphs and failures at_times in juxtaposition with each_other leaving us with the haunting moral of the story how much of a triumph is it really succeeding by punishing sometimes the innocent along with the guilty for all its rigid rough exterior the film reveals a heart that's brave and strong but vulnerable and sorrowed it's a thriller it's a drama but keeps itself in check despite the boring documentary esque undertone it was full of movement full of ironies a decade_long hunt finds itself bumped by other missions at hand time after time a long wanted terrorist hiding in plain sight found by a young woman working for the cia straight out of high school.i had the same problem with zero_dark thirty that i did with lincoln it was a dull way of telling a very interesting story it's filmed like a documentary so that's what it feels like chastain is great but it doesn't make up for the fact that it's told in a boring manner don't get me wrong it's still good very good it just didn't live up to its full potential.really liked it except when it was dark and i couldn't see anything take out the hollywood and this would have_been amazing oh to have_been a fly on the wall during the actual_events it was really well_acted and filmed but i have to admit that i was a little bored waiting 2.5 hours for something i knew was going to happen.so i guess kathryn_bigelow the go to director for realistic military thrillers now unlike the hurt_locker which tailed off dramatically after the first_half this manages to keep a restrained consistency throughout and have an ending that is filled with tension and satisfaction it's pretty humourless though and i'm not expecting a laugh a minute obviously but everyone is always so stern faced and serious and it grates a bit it got a lot of oscar buzz but i just see it as a well_done slow burning thriller rather than the amazing thing it was built up to be.didnt live up to the expectationswonderfully done movie everyone should be able to enjoy very suspenseful.great and very deep storyone of the best movies of 2012this looks like oscar bait but i want to watch this still because of how well the director handles her stuff.this movie is severely overrated while suspenseful it is overdone and the screen writing could use a lot of work i especially hate how they make the protagonist's main goal in life to find osama then at the end they need to make it so overly dramatic that the pilot asks her where she wants to go and she says i don't_know like she has no more meaning in life.this one will keep you on your toestuesday november 19 2013 2012 zero_dark thirty docu drama war anyone expecting this to be another desert war movie like bigelow's previous film the hurt_locker will be gravely disappointed since it centers on cia operatives involving the whereabouts of osama_bin laden shown at_times like a docu drama with no plot and by accordingly to one person who's also a cia operative she is being played by jessica_chastain which during the first few minutes has one of the detainees getting tortured or abused in exchange for information now i just want to say that the controversy regarding torture tactics methods has been used in movies before some are based_on fact some not the viewers who are offended by this practice either hasn't seen enough movies about it since i can name about 3 movies that does this too which're battle of algiers death and the maiden and prisoners or that viewers may have thought of other ethical ways of obtaining information as well as ignore practices practiced by extremists since in this particular film it appears these particular extremists do have a secret pact to keep vital information to themselves and keeping them in a cell doesn't seem to do anything if suicidal explosions continue to happen before and after the fact throughout the world including india great britain and of course usa now this passable rating does not mean that the movie is bad it just means that i had different expectations and different accounts regarding the events such as the seal_team that executed bin_laden strategizing and performing their route multiple times since it was kind of like a fortress and in this film all we were given is just the model of the household where bin_laden's been hiding i mean where's this rigorous training we've heard so much about and because bin_laden was actually executed by seal_team six i would've preferred to have seen the tough rigid training they had to endure before performing the mission took_place and this film only based_on the accounts by one person and that is maya played by jessica_chastain did the information such as discs hard drives files that seal_team six obtained from the location where osama_bin laden's been shot ever come out of it for their was no aftermath did it led to more arrests where's cia director leon panetta and david petraeus how much are they involved in all of this the movie never explains for it sometimes feels somewhat restrained making viewers asking more questions and i can understand why if other people who were also involved did not want to get involve into the filming preparation that led up to how can a single person find bin_laden when it also has to involve many others for it should be perceived as a group effort and not so much as a single one this film was never boring but after the movie was over i was still baffled despite the end result and hoping for an aftermath for the film never gave us one 2.5 out of 4 starsyeah it's gritty and extremely well made but for me it was just a bit too convoluted and way too long.the actors do a good job at showing their frustrations at the situation there are some pretty good scenes if the scene with the helicopter is real what a bunch goofs suspenseful and gripping zero_dark thirty is an excellent film based_on the events that led to osama_bin laden's fall.it's predictable i don't_know i fell asleep duringsuch a great movie but the end was lacking hats off to jessica_chastain gripping and powerful.i fell asleep during this movie but woke up to see the endit took a bit to get into this one clearly knowing the outcome once we got passed the brutal methods of interrogation it was grim and suspenseful not sure how accurate or how they got some of the classified information jessica_chastain was great and the kathryn_bigelow mark_boal team is fantastic again one thing i will note is that despite the triumph of killing the world's most_wanted man there was no big victory scene and i could feel the heaviness of 9_11 once_again really well done.i just can't agree with the rotten tomato folks here i thought this movie dragged a bit quite a bit in some places i think everyone wanted it to be a successful follow up to hurt_locker which is a much better movie this movie is the cinematic equivalent of the breaking news phenomenon we have_been dealing with this week there is a story to tell but it only goes skin deep we know it will have significant meaning to our nation some day but we don't have the historical perspective to frame the message yet so here's a bunch of random and confusing elements followed up the painstakingly methodical march through osama's house in time we're hoping these scenes will add up to more than the sum of the parts my grade may change in 15 years when i have some perspective to see this through but for now c great movie really good and suspense from the start of the 1st min of the movie i saw it opening day last year and was say still the whole movie well written and great ploy from the war in 2003 and continuing until the executive order from the president to have the seal_team t ale care of the threat thands down damn good movie.it was a bad movie it took 2 hours for the movie to basically get to the main part it was boring.classic jessica_chastain acted naturally as she always does infact everybody did that still don't get it why the film did not get the oscari went into this movie as a canadian who isn't pro america and doesn't have much of an opinion in the war on terror 9_11 period of history other then it is appalling what had happened and how it affected me personally so without as much of an emotional attachment i sat down and watched zero_dark thirty and i was impressed strictly from an entertainment perspective it was suspenseful intense at_times hard to watch but always entertaining the action_sequences are well_done usually with great perspective making you feel like you are in on the assault the music is great at enhancing the mood in any given scene and the acting is stellar throughout even_though the ending is a celebrated moment in u.s history and is probably known by most of the viewing public i still found myself on edge throughout the final sequence which is a testament to the filmmakers.watch it if you want to spend 2 hr 37 min it was a very slow paced movie i feel like nothing is happening through the movie and then they just end up kill bin_laden zero_dark thirty dramatizes the decade_long manhunt for al_qaeda leader osama_bin laden after the september_11 2001 9_11 terrorist_attacks in the united_states then the search eventually leads to the discovery of his compound in pakistan and the military raid on it that results in his death in 2011 the movie stars jessica_chastain jason_clarke joel_edgerton chris_pratt jennifer_ehle mark strong kyle_chandler edgar ramirez and directed by kathryn_bigelow 2012 sure was and had a lot of great historical films to offer bigelow has created a film that stays gripping and historic and chastain's performance stays strong and heartwarming zero_dark thirty is a near masterpiece in the historic genre and one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2012 between this or ben affleck's argo are the best historical films of 2012 if you like military movies you will enjoy zero_dark thirty.an outstanding film especially the last 45_minutes zero_dark thirty takes an hour and 45_minutes to build the suspense that captain phillips did in 15 minutes the action scenes from 1 45 to 2 15 are first rate but they are marred by the unjustified rationalization of torture that disfigures the first_half of the film.very well made not over the top not hero saves the world but more of a warts and all look at whatever info we'll probably ever get to know about how they found and killed bin_laden the film makers were happy to show the weakness of the cia set up and didn't overdramatise to the point where i had to look up whether one particular scene actually happened because it seemed so unbelievably stupid of the cia that i wondered whether it was written in to add sympathy to their cause but no it happened and they showed it as it happened very well_done and if only more movies could learn from the power of understatement versus the monotony of sensationalism.you already_know the story and have heard of the movie so yeah it is good it is that good and with the hurt_locker team behind it you know how good it can be very well_done a bit educational for those who did not follow events as the transpired and solid entertainment for those who did.lacks the emotional to keep my ass sit through the 2.5 hours it feels like a stack of classified documents printed on sandpaper rubbing on my face.not a fan of america anyway i still liked zero_dark thirty for it's excellent directing from a good person at that job an acceptable cast and truly suspenseful i still hate when people celebrate murder though.a tale of military intrigue and questionable morals made all the more chilling by the fact that it's completely true the only thing more amazing than the fact that this tale can be told at all is that it is told with such neutrality and objectivity that one does not expect from a political thriller of this calibre.wow that was pretty good our_country is the shit just sayinstarts slowly but it's worth the wait the torture scenes might be a bit intense for some zero_dark thirty is a very insightful depiction of the manhunt for osama_bin laden i particularly admired it for its lack of triumphalism and sanctimonious patriotism a film like zero_dark thirty could have easily turned into a piece of wartime propaganda but it didn't this is a movie that presents this manhunt as a situation with a large grey area the viewer definitely cannot look at this movie and say muslims are bad and americans are good this is especially true with the film's portrayal of torture and the manner in which the last few moments of the film were crafted.the death of bin_laden was by no means cathartic no huge celebration no happy moment where the seals revel in their deed instead we are given a long headshot of maya jessica_chastain with tearful eyes feeling the effects of what her 10_year manhunt has yielded.overall this is a great film and it was done in good taste definitely a must_see for anyone interested films based_on historical events or for anyone who just enjoys a good movie.kathryn bigelow casts aside politics in her emotionally detached suspense drama which should be commended for her refusal to celebrate the hunt and killing of bin_laden rather she decides to play it as authentically as possible a gripping and suspenseful thriller that benefits from its cohesive storytelling and a great performance from jessica_chastain its material was crafted very well that if you consider watching it again you'll discover something new.zd30 was the best feature length real episode of homeland ever.good riveting writing should've been best picturenot as good as i hoped but its oksurprisingly gripping with acts of our american family that show persistence in the face of unfathomable odds times of morality v justice bring thoughtful moments of clarity to one of the pinnacles of our storied history.i wanted to like this so much but it was just so much lead up to something that took 10 minutes also i wasn't as big of a fan of jessica's performance as i'd thought i'd be either overall it was good but not that good.amazing screenplay gripping throughout never mind the politics surrounding it it's a great filmtoo little too_long not a bad film though but still crazy carrie does it better pinteresting film torture scenes were uncomfortable but i guess all countries do it good ending poignantdidn't like the ending but overall it was a really good movie.gritty realistic extremely well_acted and refreshingly with a complete lack of hollywood gloss good movie but there are a few inaccuracies9 10 my respect again for director kathryn_bigelow for producing such a grim and accurate depiction of this cia thriller incredibly gripping this movie had me literally on the edge of my_seat for entire 2.5 hours argo 2012 is good but personally i rate this is much higher because of its realistic and authenticity feel of the film.the hurt_locker bored me to nearly death but zero_dark thirty is just amazing and exciting here's the best made film with a bad premise of 2012 zero_dark thirty chronicles the hunt for osama_bin laden and that's it jessica_chastain plays a workaholic cia_agent who is obsessed with the case she improves after every performance and if she continues she's winning an oscar next time she has such a range a plays a character we have never seen before she carries the entire film kathryn_bigelow directs with realism and seriousness the death scene involving bin_laden is one of the three best directed scenes of the year we never see his face very clearly which is ingenious since it would take the realism out of the story even the screenplay involves great characters great pacing some jargon filled dialogue and a clear and nice organisation the editing is equally immaculate in the sound and video category it takes a mess of found footage filmed scenes and manages to make a clear and concise scene however the film drags a lot there is no reason we need to see the assassination of bin_laden and especially not in two hours and forty minutes the film's premise kills it making it boring pointless void of emotion and shallow zero_dark thirty would be my second favorite film of 2012 were it not for its blatantly stupid premise.zero dark_thirty a long ass movie about the war on terrorism and how the usa were basically non_stop on the hunt to get bin_laden and the ups and downs the went through to so call win the war.the fact of the matter is on the path to justice this movie also shows the wrong doings and still no one was accountable for that.ok enough of my own crappy opinion.if your into these american war flicks or even of your a call of duty player i would reckon you would enjoy this film.the film was again very lengthy heaps of dialogue and in the end they get the bad guy as well already_know through what we have seen on actual news.not suitable for the kiddies at all.have a look if you wanna see but again the only reason why i gave it two stars was it was very lengthy and it was very usa patriotic.a one time watch for me.let me start by saying this film is not for everyone it has intense and very realistic scenes depicting torture and other brutal acts upon captured suspected terrorists kathryn_bigelow garners critical acclaim once_again shortly after the hurt_locker with another very realistic and gritty depiction of our modern conflics overseas and captures the whole affair with wonderful realism gripping violent suspenseful and intelligently written zero_dark thirty is a wonderful dramatization of one of the most modern issues of the u.s and world affairs.excellent thought_provoking paced thriller if you want to bring down the bad guys be prepared for what you must be and do.it was great wooohooooooooo what is life after seeing this enjoyed the true as possible story line they could show but was upset there wasn't as much action that i was hoping to be.much to my dismay zero_dark thirty isn't what i imagined it was going to be but it's better_than it seems let's get the torture out of the way first it's wrong but so are suicide bombers neither is what it claims to be so when they appear in the film they cancel each_other out the film gets a bit melodramatic at_times with over the top speeches about losing and winning but all in all i enjoyed the recreation of the hunt for osama_bin laden what i didn't enjoy was the pretty ineffective storytelling of this tale which has a certain on again off again characteristic which doesn't make for good cinema i must say this the compound breach sequence at the end of the film had me deep in my chair almost paralyzed with it's masterful imagery and hats of the cinematographer who filmed that sequence in pitch black night at_least that's what it looks like ineffective storytelling really drags the film down but if you are an espionage nut like you're going to watch it recommended for you then.has a few pacing issues and didn't sweep me off my feet like hurt_locker but still an intense film.lots of talking and not as much action as i expected i got interested after the first little bit but then got distracted and bored movies where you know the ending already shouldn't be so long there is no suspense in that situation and you just end up getting annoyed at the buildup well this was good important but lacked the it factor for all the hype it was given.well this was good important but lacked the it factor for all the hype it was given.great action movie and acting wasn't as bad as i would have thought overall this film continuously had me thinking what else has happened that we don't_know other films like argo have it's detail but once_again questioning government intelligence is simply a mirage.o filme que fala sobre a opera\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xa3o que deflagrou a captura de osama_bin laden \\xc3\\xa9 vazio apatico guerra ao terror \\xc3\\xa9 um cl\\xc3\\xa1ssico perto delea well directed film that comes off a bit forgettable even with the massive story it takes two and a half hours to tell to be sure zero_dark thirty tells one of the biggest stories of our lifetime but while it does a lot of things goo it never does anything great as far as true stories go it is one that will be around for years to come but won't be one that will be re watched all that much.a masterpiece of a thriller spy film done with so much intelligenceplot was slow predictable and uninteresting all of the characters were underdeveloped the last_30 minutes are really what everyone wanted to see not the rest of the movie however even the raid was a disapointment it is some of the best overrated movies of all time it does not fit the praise it is recieving its a movie you watch only once just to tell people you saw it and will likely never want to see it again don't watch this movie expecting a cool spy espionage film worst movie of 2012 for me.three years after kathryn_bigelow after a relatively quiet few decade_long film directing career really showed what she was capable of with the iraq war masterpiece the hurt_locker she comes with a movie far more ambitious and also quite a bit more controversial about the decade_long search for osama_bin laden from 9_11 until no spoiler alert necessary he was killed in a raid operation by navy_seals called zero_dark thirty it absolutely lives up to if not surpasses her previous oscar winning effort.bigelow's passion for this subject is in just about every shot with immense detail cold bluntness and enough humanity to keep it from being too oppressing actually for a two and a half_hour film it's quite efficient filmmaking jam packed with numerous interrogations and investigation tactics the torture stuff that has garnered controversy is only a very small part of that shaking real_life terrorist_attacks and political wrangling yet it's never confused or disjointed even towards the end with the recreations of the raid on the compound in pakistan done very deliberately the pacing is never betrayed with consistent movement and direction it's a scene that plays out as much mystery more as suspense as the seal_team goes from room to room blowing out locked doors and not knowing for certain if the main target is there the movie's structure with one main_character maya a member of the cia played brilliantly by jessica_chastain taking a part in virtually every aspect of this manhunt with other people revolving in their various tasks around her was the perfect choice if one person really did have this much impact on the manhunt we'll probably never know for sure but in this film it's played out believably and compellingly and though no one can match her neither is anyone else insignificant to how it plays out characters with only a few scenes have noticeable impacts but with maya is the emotion determination the sassiness and intelligence of a woman who evolves in nuanced but never uninteresting ways zero_dark thirty is an incredible achievement and in my mind candidate for best film made so far this decade it has brought about an important debate but more significantly it covers ten years of the war on terror in prime fashion bigelow plays for high realism but she also knows how to create great drama by stretching it but never breaking those confines every scene belongs for a purpose and never does it feel like one is missing that in itself is an incredible achievement credit her the cast and not to forget the great script by mark boal.kathryn bigelow has bring us yet another intense very strong and amazing film with zero_dark thirty as this film focus on the mission to kill bid laden this brings a lot of strong themes into the wrting a story that makes you think a lot of and lets not forget about jessica_chastain's amazing performance this is one of the most intense films i have ever seen.the bin liner is dead gripping.the last scene with chastain crying really makes you think yes we got him at what cost i absolutely loved this movie even_though we knew the outcome you were still in suspense every step of the way.thoroughly enjoyed this film gripping from start to finish definitely recommend watching this movie.it was more exciting and suspensful than i expected especially towards the climax.riuscitissima pellicola bravissime regista e protagonista riescono a rendere perfettamente l'idea dello stress e dell'usura psicologica legati ad un certo tipo di lavoro sporco da un lato ma probabilmente necessario dall'altra.the movie was very well_done the story the acting all phenomenal though a bit slow with what some would call too many still moments at_least for a movie that was supposed to be somewhat of an epic thrill ride to the capture of osama the fact is that we all knew the story's ending prior to the movie so this movie instead did a awesome job capturing the real world of the soldiers the government and the women behind it all in this filmpretty good movie seemed to drag on longer than it should have but then the invasion at the end was pretty sweet the end is the reason we are all tolerating the over filler leading_up to it oh wait sorry is that a spoiler for anyone a grim bio pic done right this truley shows the power that kathryn_bigelow holds behind a camera raw and dark with a pitch perfect script this movie about the hunt for bin_laden will shake you to the core with realism and attention to detail.a dark meaningful serious and i fell asleep.the third_act will stick with you incredibly endearing.i suspect much or all of this is fiction since i believe obl was dead ten years before the time period of the film the film is also too_long despite that this is a well written beautifully crafted film jessica_chastain is brilliant fits in well with my_favorite cia films.this film could have given argo a run for its money had it not been surrounded by controversies it's a shame that jessica_chastain's unparalleled performance became the collateral damage the direction is precise the cast is spot on and the story could not have_been more riveting easily one of the best films of 2012 intense great film realistically and accurately pieced together study on the hunt for bin ladenwell done dramatic thriller worth the watch.brilliant film loved it mindblowing documentary esque film that really gives the audience a sense of fear frustration anger pure excitement and relief throughout the entire hunt for bin_laden the dialogue and emotion portrayed between the characters in each and every scene is just simply perfect supports the case for best movie of 2012 great this needs your full attention torture is nasty business but necessary for the end prize long road dead leads lies confusion with brothers bribes lamborghinis etc.when you lie to me i hurt you.the u.s government is doing their best to bring down those responsible for the attacks on 9_11 they have agents interrogating suspects in pakistan and afghanistan however as agents they are constantly under the attack of the taliban after five long years of research a female may have cracked the code and solved the mystery of osama_bin laden do your fucking jobs bring me people to kill kathryn_bigelow director of near dark point break k 19 and the hurt_locker delivers zero_dark thirty the storyline for this picture is very fascinating dramatic informative and action_packed i adored the characters and sub plots and the acting was perfect the cast includes jason_clarke jessica_chastain jeremy strong and alexander karim i have time you don't i have other things to do you don't i only watched this when someone gave me the dvd i am shocked at how much i enjoyed this movie i thought this would be a clich\\xc3\\xa9 military tactical film but this was borderline black_hawk down good the action was good the drama was intense and the conclusion was perfect i strongly recommend seeing this movie and even potentially adding it to your dvd collection this is what defeat looks like grade ainteresting but far too longthe brutality of the film comes from its sense of objectivitysometimes a little protracted confused and tiresome but still a really good movie.did you know that the seal_team that killed bin_laden is now dead chopper accident kind of makes one wonder read between the lines peopl.if you live in america and are not captivated by this movie i don't_know what will captivate you.incredible movie i expected an action movie but was pleasantly surprised at how story driven this film was the actor who plays maya does an incredible job at portraying her character a must see.the first_half of this is rather slow but this is one of the few times a director can justify how methodically the story is built up the intro with the recordings of 911 and other calls from the towers on sept 11 is very sobering and reminds us that while we may see this as a movie it isn't a fake story jessica_chastain's performance builds up the tension and obsession along with the damage it is doing to her by the end of the film she's completely spent and alone with no idea what's next jason_clarke is solid as her supervisor one of the interrogators ie torturers who's work we see a few times when this film really takes off is in the second_half when the compound is found and chastain's character is jumping up and down for them to take it out or at_least get in there it's a very effective device to have her walk up to the window of boss mark strong and write the ever increasing of days since they've sat on the info until finally there is action once that action starts it really is can't miss film at it's best when a poi reappears long thought dead chastain's maya pushes hard to get people following him and makes an impassioned plea to one of the ops a very solid edgar ramirez and then we see the cat and mouse chase of trying to find a needle in a haystack one man in a crowded pakistan town this is where things really pick up and build the tension suspense anticipation and nerves just ooze out of everyone here joel_edgerton and chris_pratt are fantastic as 2 members of the seal_team that goes in also frank grillo in fine form i also appreciated that this film didn't flinch in depicting what_happened there were no cut away or glossing over of the operation.the performances here were also quite solid from chastain especially and also stephen dillane and james_gandolfini as cia white house higher ups kyle_chandler mark strong jennifer_ehle as cia staff bosses and the aforementioned seal team.a strong film that builds itself up methodically and while that may take away from some of it i think a pure action film here would have_been a disservice to the subject matter.the whole movie may not be totally accurate but this movie has an eye for details it's the details put together that made this an award winning moviegeronimo for god and country it is kind of a documentary but not it shows how much work went into finding and killing bin_laden how for months all sorts of people in all sorts of places spent ages catching people watching people setting drone and camera's up pretending to be other people getting info out of other people listening to phone calls and messages and how well hidden he actually was and how close he was to a big town but how he had well and truely planned his home and everything around it so he could never be seen or caught that no camera's could be put anywhere how they couldn't get into the drainage how they couldn't get in through gates the high walls the blanked out windows the angle the roof was at so you couldn't see people below it the garden at the back so you couldn't see it etc and how he had other people go out for him but how little slip up's here and there eventually turned into a big slip up and they got there man and how unplanned and how the main person doing all the leg work was a woman and how she had to convince some of the most important and powerful people she was right about a hunch and they should take action what i hated was the fact the ending was shit they'd got there man she confirmed it was him she got on a plane crying and that was it it never explained what else they found about bin_laden what they did with him what_happened to her and why she was crying i hate films that don't explain everything especially films that are based_on true storys or on actual life events or global events that need explaining other than that it was a really good film just wish they'd explained the ending better and not just left it like that for the amount of awards it won.nothing i believe has come as close to reality as this one does kathryn_bigelow take a bow one of the best films i've_seen for a long time jessica_chastain does a fantastic job and kathryn_bigelow once_again directs produces a terrific piece of work if you like the hurt_locker you'll love this.a dark gritty film well worth_watching but imo its too long.a gripping taut thriller that improves on what kathryn_bigelow accomplished in hurt_locker on almost every level as the story unfolds you're almost convinced you're watching a documentary and in some respects that's the one downside to the film it has to stay so faithful to the reality of the situations it portrays that it can't take many film like liberties.i'm told this is good i will have to get round to watching it sometime brilliant performances and a taught atmosphere make this a tense movie to watch despite knowing the outcome.kathryn bigelow is empress of suspense and drama idk why ppl hated final scene was dope as hell.not so much a political movie but a character study and an excellent one at that the final_30 minutes are some of the most riveting i've_ever seen.rather vague to start with had no idea what was going on really but became more cohesive by the endthis is a tough film to evaluate on the one hand it is a gripping thriller along the lines of any of the recent string of politically themed action films the bourne films argo etc from this perspective it keeps the viewer engaged for a considerable running_time with its suspense manhunt plot jessica_chastain is solid as the key cia_agent on bin_laden's trail on the other hand for a film purporting to be a re enactment more or less of actual_events it has a number of problematic elements for example although it seems to take a relatively objective stance unflinchingly showing torture by cia officials and murder assassination of bin_laden and his associates without trial it also encourages viewers to identify not only with the mission but with the characters who use torture and assassination as tools and who lament the fact that politics may prevent them from continuing to do so so in the future when people learn about this chapter of american history from this film rather than from uh books they may take on board the implicit message that suggests revenge by any means necessary is fair game this of course wasn't supposed to be the american way of doing things.maya is an aggressive strong and sometimes stubborn woman yet somehow she is incredibly feminine it is propably because of her singlemindedness and instinct when tackling details but it is exactly her motivation patriotism and the yearning for truth that creates her inexplicable charm truth is art's highest calling for it the facts must sometimes be adjusted zero_dark thirty meets the demands of truth roger cohen the nyt this movie represents courage honor and glory thanks to our troops who got the one's that attacked us and brought them to justice america means we are united as a family and this movie shows that these troops that got the terrorist are family god_bless this movie the victims of 9_11 and god_bless the united_states of america.i remember in my 11th grade us history class being assigned howard zinn's a people's history of the united_states i wouldn't say this book opened my eyes but i was super pleased to be officially given a non bullshit view of america in history it was all yeah so like basically we wanted a panama canal so we overthrew the democratically elected leader of panama and installed an evil dictator sympathetic to our interests yep don't get me wrong here i'm an american and i think america is great sure we're extremely vicious when attacked see pearl_harbor nagasaki hiroshima but we're also more generous than we have to be see marshall plan even when we fuck up see japanese internment we later attempt redress our presidents officially apologized for that and gave some 1 billion in repayment most countries don't do that we didn't have to consider even the biggest argument against america economic imperialism which is absolutely true but think about how much worse it could be we try to convert people to our way of life by bringing them prosperity unlike the roman empire or the british empire we prefer not to send troops but iphones so stop bitching with that said america has fucked up fairly often and it's important to acknowledge that zero_dark thirty isn't acknowledging any wrong doing but it does have that same sense of truth telling kathryn_bigelow has created a movie which tries to simply tell the story of osama_bin laden's discovery and execution without all the cumbersome moral posturing that would have_been shoe horned into a lesser film as such i was pleased with it detainees are tortured and though the guy doing the torture clearly doesn't enjoy it and later admits to growing weary of it there's no clear message of its rightness or wrongness later in the tense well_done depiction of the assault on bin_laden's compound an unarmed woman is shot as she wails on top of her dead husband likewise there was no moment where the soldier got all choked up about it and freaked out i appreciated this i appreciated that this film leaves the moral questions up to the viewer is torture ever justified do those who willingly harbor mass murderers terrorists shoulder some of the burden of the evil i might offer my own answers but then that'd be missing the point wouldn't it final say it was a good film technically proficient and entertaining with that said i honestly don't think i'm ever willing to give a political thriller a full 5_stars the character arcs always feel very flat they never feel very creative so i can't actually come up with a reason why i'm deducting a star but i'm going to do it anyway which is my final say it's a well_done political thriller as good as it was it's not exactly going to haunt your dreams how to watch it honestly it's a politically thriller probably the easiest movie of any type to watch i mean sure you might respond how can anyone mess up watching a movie you just have to sit there and open your eyes and ears well yes but a lot of people have a hard time with that and with keeping their brain open as well political thriller though ez pz open mind closed mind open eyes closed eyes it's all the same trivia while filming zdt the director kathryn_bigelow winner of best director for the hurt_locker rescued and cared for a stray dog.film \\xc3\\xa0 la hauteur de mes attentes de kathryn_bigelow c'est plus politique et moins terrain que hurt_locker que j'ai ador\\xc3\\xa9 mais \\xc3\\xa7a demeure tout de m\\xc3\\xaame un film de guerre tr\\xc3\\xa8s int\\xc3\\xa9ressant.epic manhunt with the ultimate payoff amazingly manages to keep the tension going right to the final of its 157 minutes even_though everyone on the planet knows how it ends.i wouldn't have nominated this movie for best picture thats for sure but this movie was definitely gripping suspenseful and extremely well_acted especially by jessica_chastain even_though we already_know whats going to happen in the end the movie is still interesting that's pretty tough to do one big issue however is that there are a lot of pointless scenes that take up a noticeable running_time still this is a solid thrilling adaptation of the hunt for osama_bin laden.intensity i love the very last moment of this movie.is it a true_story parts are probably is it entertaining parts are certainly but there's a lot of boring story development and the movie just lags in parts it's average nothing more.i went expecting a red blooded american shoot em up and what i got was a nuanced look into the difficulties of waging war against people instead of countries one of the best movies_i've seen in a while.i wanted to like this but just didn't it's good to have a factual account of events but when a film has no likeable character whatsoever i think they should take a bit of artistic license.the last 20_minutes or so were good though chastain was just plain annoying but nice to see coach taylor severride in a film.one line summary well crafted exposition of the search for bin_laden from the cia pov the film follows current history from just before the 9_11 2001 attacks through the successful finding and execution of usama bin_laden in may of 2011 maya is the centre of the piece she is a new analyst for the cia in pakistan shortly after the 2001 attacks when maya's friend jessica plus six other cia operatives are killed by al_qaeda maya becomes even more focused on finding bin_laden and seeing to it that he is killed the film concludes with the successful raid by seal_team six on the compound where bin_laden had been staying in pakistan scores cinematography 8 10 the extended night_vision sequences were low on detail the film's look and feel though was convincingly accurate sound 9 10 good acting 10 10 excellent performances by jessica_chastain jason_clarke kyle_chandler harold perrineau james_gandolfini screenplay 8 10 tight and nicely crafted but just too_long the insistence on accuracy about the compound and the attack helicopters was quite rewarding if you have access to the dvd the extras are well worth watching.a riveting gut churningly tense and eye_opening window into the brutal and bloody world of post_9 11 intelligence gathering what i love most about this film and others such as green zone and the hurt_locker is that they rely on our unconsciously conditioned racism to make the scenes suspenseful tentative rating awaiting the chance to view again to give accurate rating.really good 8.4 10 a was ok like watching cnn reruns same story no new incitea very likable film suspenseful up until the end.pretty good movie plot was close to the bookabout it.a gripping and gritty film especially in the latter half the first_half dragged somewhat and meandered through the years leading_up to the operation a bit more than seemed absolutely necessary.good but gets a little confusing.a difficult viewing but one that poses many open ended questions neither an endorsement nor a condemnation of the tactics used to seek justice and enact revenge and that is this films greatest strength.no words this film is nothing short of brilliant kathryn_bigelow is such a talented director she manages to keep the tension so taut for so much of the film at the same as letting you forget for just a second what you can sense is about to happen her timing and that of her editor is perfect film making how she is not nominated for an oscar and the favourite to win it for a film that is superior to the hurt_locker the film she did win one for is a mystery this is exhilarating cinema that not once delves in the melodramatic or unbelievable.jessica chastain who i have praised a number of times before has again delivered a performance so versatile so nuanced so strong that she really is one of the best and most reliable actors working now the way she develops and grows this character over the 10 years we follow her is so interesting to watch the last shot in the film is simply perfection from her but not just her it should be noted that in another screenwriter or directors hands the film and the final shot could have so easily drifted to the far too patriotic the far too obvious the fact that it didn't means that it will stay with me for some time.if you are a fan of the tv show homeland you will love this film the parallels are plainly obvious but unlike homeland this is anchored in so much more realism and believability there is no melodrama here.i loved it and i can't wait to watch it again.three and a half stars.captivating chastain was amazing had to hide my eyes from the interrogation stuff but otherwise was fantastic.as great of a story as this should be it is very slow and not easy to follow there is no development of any kind and there are many scenes that are so dark in picture quality you can not even see what is going on too_long and should be considered a documentary instead of a theatrical movie the acting was performed quite well though.executed with perfection aha u know what i mean a truly incredible performance from chastain that should have landed her an oscar an on edge story of the true manhunt.of the many movies that have resulted from the afghanistan iraq wars of the past decade most have had a negative slant and have highlighted some of the worst aspects of the experiences on the other hand zero_dark thirty focuses on the long challenging effort of bringing the man who started it all to justice the film directed by academy_award winner kathryn_bigelow takes a microscopic approach to demonstrate just how difficult it was to plan for and carry out the mission to kill osama_bin laden from an entertainment standpoint thirty does a good job of drawing in the audience right off the bat thanks to a scene that drew a lot of criticism and while there are times when things start to slow down there are consistent bursts of excitement that keep the audience from getting lost in the weeds of war this all culminates in a nail biting final 20_minutes that are hard to forget besides the subject_matter the biggest selling point of thirty is jessica_chastain whose work in this movie was rewarded with an academy_award nomination chastain's portrayal of determined cia_agent maya is on point and believable her tenacity and ability to take all of the curveballs lobbed at her in stride is refreshing while it's difficult to know how many elements of thirty are actually true it's important to remember that it's just a film and there are creative licenses that are taken when producing it zero_dark thirty is a smart gritty thriller that pays homage to the real heroes of operation neptune spear striking a balance that's difficult to come across nowadays.grisly tense and fascinating chastain's fantastic performance and bigelow's slick smart direction are a perfect match.absolute edge of the seat thriller.intense thought_provoking and expertly crafted zero_dark thirty is one of 2012 s best filmsalready sat through 1 mediocre bigelow war film no desire to see thisthis film is overrated in my_opinion it's just a good film.ao que parece temos filme confesso \\xc3\\xa3 c que nunca percebi porque \\xc3\\xa3 c que lhe deram o \\xc3\\xa3 scar pelo hurt_locker e n\\xc3\\xa3 o pelo point break ou strange days.solid dark both intense and tense at different times and thankfully more underplayed than most films of its genre don't expect anything other than the occasional nod to the issue of ethics or the complexities around the subject_matter though i didn't anticipate liking much at all but despite the unpleasant topic it's a gripping dramatic movie.intense movie from start to finishthe hurt_locker proved to me that kathryn_bigelow knows how to make gripping military movies and i expect this to be no different i have high hopes that this will be as great if not better_than the hurt locker.a silent smash hit about the gripping realism surrounding capture of osama outstanding work by bigalow and is one up against her hubby.not my_favorite subject_matter but watched it anyway because of the reviews i thought that it was strong in terms of acting but i just couldn't buy the fact that they went after bin_laden on a hunch by one single cia_agent but of course they had to do it this way because if not then it would've_been a documentary i suppose i think the story to be told is intriguing and relevant but the filmmakers just didn't satisfy me with this adaptation.la noche m\\xc3\\xa1s oscura 2012 gripping more so because it's true interesting to see how the usa treats it's captives.kept my attention and want to watch it again to make sure i did not miss anything.alost believable except for all the talking on the mission down range that would never happen on a real op.i love the realism in this movie we got him not a fan of terrorist intelligence military movies but this wasn't bad it was a pretty good film even_though i fell asleep halfway through it had it's own tone and pace unique to most other modern films which i greatly appreciate.tense taut drama that centres on the hunt for bin_laden fascinating and gripping stuff.subtle detail oriented and intelligent zero_dark thirty is fascinating procedural that is at_times brutally suspenseful the character of maya occasionally leans a bit too heavy into being the smartest woman in the room a classic trope that you'll find in argo as well but jessica_chastain sells it jason_clarke is equally excellent offering some truly incredible and subtle moments of characterization just watch his face when he says that naked guys line there's a reductive quality to pinning the entire investigation almost entirely on one woman but the trade off is a rather poignant kind of emotional and metaphorical catharsis that comes with one woman taking on the taliban it's kind of a catch 22 so your mileage may vary.also a modicum of intelligence makes the films stance on torture clear it certainly doesn't endorse it so don't be swayed by the tabloid nonsense.although you know parts of it had to be fictionalized and thrown in for flavor there's a real feeling of authenticity brought on by solid performances from the cast led by jessica_chastain and outstanding direction from kathryn_bigelow intense is probably the best word to describe the final act of the film i was nervous just watching it goddamn a movie that benefits from its incredible performancesvery well and fairly directed doesn't shy away from the more brutal aspects of our gung hi ism will be a great film time capsule of this moment in history one of these days but i was a little uneasy with a film about real americans lost and still in the field being so entertaining an important movie.great film tells the story but perhaps tells more about the seals that the public needs to know.this film is a fantastic blend of mystery with a villain the viewer actually cares about locating drama much like the political talkies as michael clayton and the ides of march a bit of torture porn like a watered down hostile pun intended with more unnerving humiliation than gore and a hint of action similar to black_hawk down and kathryn_bigelow s 2010 academy_award winning film the hurt_locker even_though the moral ambiguity of this film's subject_matter the assassination of osama_bin laden may leave some moviegoers wary about viewing this picture for the first time bigelow refrains from taking any sides which allows the viewer to interpret u.s.a and pakistan's violent behavior with their_own eyes much like argo this film continuously increases the tension but argo and zero_dark thirty are as different as a charles schulz comic and a picasso painting while argo prides itself on its simplicity zero_dark thirty covers almost a decade of time without feeling rushed or choppy.very remarkable film the first two hours were a little bit slow but the last forty minutes was really really good and intense overall the entire movie was very remarkable 80 excellent war movie good companion to this movie would be mark owen's book no easy day which focuses more intimately on the entire mission to take out bin_laden zero_dark thirty spends more time on the tedious history of events which lead to his capture so the perspective is different.a plus of zero_dark thirty is that the brash female government employee responsible for not taking no for an answer and is the main person responsible for finding and getting bin_laden captured dominates the film she deserves it because her hard work really paid off and she obviously was dealing with a male dominated workforce so i can't imagine how she was able to tolerate that.this movie was disappointing in places even_though the acting and special_effects were excellent it just didn't give me the same adrenaline fix that mark owen's book did so be sure to read the book zero_dark thirty was way too_long boring in places and really seemed to drag on which never makes for an excellent movie no matter the subject awesome movie great story makes me proud to be an american.this movie feels incredibly long unfortunately but the last 45_minutes of the movie is so intense that it compensates for the first 2 hours plus this is probably the most realistic movie i've_ever seen without it being a documentary.i thought the film was pretty good and well_acted like most fact based movies i had a lot of insight on osama_bin laden and the real zero_dark thirty the film was really entertaining but there was a lot more to this story than what the film actually tells well worth_watching especially for jessica chastain.it was a great movie ill have to see it again i missed some of the middle i was tired and to some time to close my eyes but i mad sure to watch the last thirty minutes that is when they raid the compound and kill osama_bin ladinbem dirigido e bem atuado zero_dark thirty \\xc3\\xa9 controverso ousado eletrizante e chocante must_see after watching this movie i have to rate kathryn_bigelow as one of the best current film directors certainly the best female director of all time in her previous strong directorial effort the hurt_locker i approached her work in a sceptical way speculating about many things including her means of politicizing a movie questioning a woman's effectiveness in directing a war movie among others how wrong i was nothing in her film making has to do with her being a woman or a man all that is out of the window she is a great director that can make war movies in a different way that we are accustomed to and that is cause to celebrate she managed that in the hurt_locker and she did it again with zero_dark thirty bigelow doesn't have to include so many big explosions and much spilling of blood in her movies to portray to us the human drama and the tragedy of war zero_dark thirty is a story of perseverance and patience in an ever more violent and brutal world in the undercover war of intelligence the heroes of this drama is first and foremost an intelligent under the radar investigator by the name of maya totally dedicated to her job and her team in trying to mastermind the al_qaeda network the people involved in the dirty work of surveiling within hostile circumstances as well as the navy_seals who were in charge of getting the final phase of the job done to bring the wanted to justice as maya and her team were hitting a wall in their work combined with their_own tragedy besides their bosses getting nastier each time perseverance paid off after a change in thinking and approach maya pursued a break in the investigation without much trust and support of her own agency knowing that she wouldn't be getting the due credit even after succeeding anyway she did her heroic service and accomplish what she never thought was her target in the first place by going after a lieutenant in al_qaeda she found out that she actually uncovered none other than osama_bin laden's own hiding place in pakistan the rest is history.this acclaimed film based_on the events that lead to the eventual finding and killing of osama_bin laden is kind of a letdown ever_seen a film based_on actual_events and wonder why some events get glossed over some get rearranged and some characters end up being an amalgamation of two or three actual people zero_dark thirty is here to explain why the film goes on and on bringing up all these actual terrorist events between 9_11 and the bin_laden death do we need to see the london bus explosion or the failed attempt in times square it is too much and it goes on and on the sequence of the raid on the complex that resulted in bin_laden's death was pretty good which made me feel the film might have_been good if it had condensed the search and focused more on characters leading_up to it it just didn't work for me i think it was overhyped because the events depicted were so fresh in people's minds.por mais que a gente saiba a hist\\xc3\\xb3ria o filme mostra toda a tens\\xc3\\xa3o do momento e jessica chaistain d\\xc3\\xa1 um showvery interesting i would only watch it once but i enjoyed the information i learned from it just another fantastic film by bigelow funny even_though the climax is already known still full of suspense brilliant performance by chastainawesome movie any proud american should watch and appreciate it.kathryn bigelow directs another middle eastern thriller with the tagline of the greatest_manhunt in history zero_dark thirty is a story that we all know the outcome of it is a chronicle of the cia's most important mission of the last decade tracking down bin_laden after the 9_11 attacks it is presented at_times as a desperate and obsessive task for those involved as many dead ends occur some scenes are uncomfortable as the agents attempt to gain as much information from their prisoners as possible at_times it rushes along covering a full ten years in under three hours the acting is realistic enhanced by some dramatic camera work the final scenes of bin_laden's capture are dark and frantic making it hard to see all that is happening but this just adds to a tense atmosphere that has built up throughout.not my kind of movie it was way too detailed and i didn't really cared what_happened behind the scenes when they found bin_laden the movie dragged on and i didn't care about any of it's characters the final 20 min of the film was decent enough to give this movie a 2 5 really good chastain lives up to the hype.i'll choose documentaries over based_on actual_events films any day but this dramatization was quite good sure it boasted the proceedings of one main_character as taking full credit but it's a movie and a damn good one at that i've heard complaints about the very end spoiler alert involving jessica_chastain in an emotional state as being subjective i completely disagree in my_opinion when asked you must be pretty important where do you want to go she wept and spoke not a word as an allegory for what is still going on on the surface she knew she had nowhere really to go and no friends because of what she devoted her life to and when it ended she was left with emptiness present day this struggle is still far from over great intelligent ending i thought.it doesn't fuck around with high minded concepts like honour duty etc which makes it a vast improvement on the american ego stroking action films of the last decade as well as many of the more painfully sincere anti war films when the political intrigue and montages of writing on windows with felt tipped pens are all set aside what you have is a very well put together film of we're gunna get this bastard don't get in the way the last twenty minutes in particular is unexpectedly suspenseful despite the world's media pouring over every part of the actual even at the time plus i am not going to tell you that there is not something rather satisfying about seeing osama_bin laden getting shot in the face if ever a man deserved it however one gets the feeling this is not a film that is going to be remembered americans have a short attention span when it comes to history as it is as the turn around of 18 months from event to hollywood film show and this is more likely to be viewed in the coming decades as a short term cathartic exercise for the american psyche or a simple pat on the back than an excellent film it's good but it's not amazing.a movie about the manhunt of one of the most imfamous men in the world osama_bin laden from the wake of 9_11 to the 2011 compound raid in abbottabad.as i stated earlier this movie is intense you will see the character do anything she can and even survive attacks by terrorists so she can get her job done jessica_chastain who portrays the main_character does a great job executing her role as you would believe in some cases that she was a cia_agent action is intense direction is intense screenplay was fine and an overall thrilling experience.finally watched i was surprised by how much i liked it jessica_chastain was particularly strong.good movie acted well and accurate to facts.this movie has high production values and good performances however if you don't_know anything about this operation prior to watching it you will get a little lost in the midst of all the name dropping and acronyms.this movie has made kathryn_bigelow as the best woman director in her time a typical direction and storyline makes this movie perfect i love all her movies and this one i think one of the best movie she's ever made ending kind of sucked heavy suspense throughout the movie amazing editing that so very well crafts the facts as story elements exceptional directing which transformed a matter what should have_been a documentary into a feature film only fault of the movie is the climax as it couldnot absorb all the suspense that has been generated throughout the movieslow in places as you would expect when you know the subject_matter but still a very gripping thrilling and sometimes shocking account of the hunt for and subsequent killing of bin_laden heroics of a woman tantalizing yet fearsome highly entertaining zero_dark thirty is directed by kathryn_bigelow and written by mark_boal explaining a tale of history's past the story gives the audience a police action narrative of an individuals perspective of maya jessica_chastain a cia_agent who is on the greatest_manhunt in history her search for osama_bin laden during the entire film my heart was simply racing for more minuet information your palms will sweat and fingers will grasping the cup holders enthralling for more details listen for mark boal's brilliant dialect quotes that specifically caught my ear are:jack in the end bro everybody breaks it's biology.maya i'm the motherfucker that found this place sir.patrick squadron team leader dude do you realize what you just did by the end of the film you will be asking what is fact from fiction and how much is truly a conspiracy i now question was osama_bin laden personally responsible for the attacks on september_11 2001 killing nearly 3,000 innocent american people after doing a little bit of research i learned that on september 14 2001 the government released tapes allegedly of bin_laden confessing to the attacks on 9_11 i highly_recommend watching this 2 hour and 37 minute rated r suspenseful film.what i like about kathryn_bigelow's zero_dark thirty is that it presented itself with such soft spoken dialogue and then eventually takes you to the edge of your_seat for the last half even when you already_know the outcome.an incredible inside look into the search for the world's most_dangerous man.bravissima jessica_chastain non meno comunque di chandler clarke e la ehlereally great acting on the part of chastainwith a powerful true_story an exciting script full of intelligent dialogue written by mark_boal an incredible versatile cast headed with an amazing performance by jessica_chastain as maya wonderful directing by kathryn_bigelow spectacular scenes and sequences and a long but great pace and flow zero_dark thirty recounts the decade_long search for osama_bin laden brilliantly from the burst of 9_11 in 2001 to his death in 2011 excellent particularly if you also enjoy homeland.so thats what_happened slow burner tense endingi did not expect to enjoy this as much as i actually did with its length complicated nature and incredible detail zero_dark thirty was a fantastic piece of work jessica_chastain was brilliant in the convincing centre piece of the narrative it was long starting strong losing credit towards the middle but the final hour was terrific right down to the raid which was full of suspense and drama like the raid itself it was a precise and scintillating piece of cinema in the end it felt worth it i have little interest in the context of its accuracies of the actual_events nor its controversy in the scheme of things i watched for entertainment and it delivered if you're in the mood for something dramatic with a serious tone watch zero_dark thirty the most confusing film of 2012 first off let me start out by asking why was this film nominated for best picture and why did it win oscars it's not just the creative art work that makes up a film folks it's more than just that it's the acting the performances how the film is transferred from script to screen most importantly is it executed well what i mean by that is is the actual picture better_than the way the screenplay was written filmmakers make changes to scripts it can be for the better or it can be for the worst the reason why gave it 1 and a half stars is because the cinematography wasn't bad at all the acting was amazing as well as the performances the storyline is where i had the problem at though the film didn't execute it well it changed countries one minute were in alfganastan the next minute were in the united_states this is a very complicated movie it's hard to follow and i think in this case the basic plot of the film was way better_than the actual film my best recommendation for film goers is just rent this film i think you'll return it after you've rented it it shouldn't have_been in the oscars that's for sure it wasn't the cast members faults in this case it was the filmmakers and the production studios that helped them along with the producers and the others overall lone_survivor with mark whalberg was ten times better_than this zero_dark thirty is not one of my_favorite war pictures note i turned this film off after i was almost an hour into the film this movie is almost 3 hours if i can sit through the wolf of wall street which is 2 hours and 50 something minutes than this film is definitely as boring as sitting in your room being grounded or in jail watching only the walls and the guards walk by.while it is pretty slow and overrated i found it interesting on how they got bin_laden it had some great parts to it with the tone of the hurt_locker good time no alcohol required.zero dark_thirty for the most part is riveting engaging and ultimately satisfying as it accurately portrays the hunt for bin_laden great acting by chastain what would've made it even better is further editing and further character development.a intriguing journey through years of work and typical political paralysis.one of the best movie made on any historical event and one of the best of 2012 great movie even better when you understand how things work.zero dark_thirty is one of the best film of 2013 not quite worthy of the hype it received but i did find it more engaging than its companion piece the hurt_locker considering that anyone going in to watch this already knows how it's going to end it is reasonably suspenseful in its final stages and overall it does feel a very personal take on what was a global issue it's quite subtle and merely states the facts rather than revelling in the triumphalism of its conclusion.great job on telling a great story about great men.greatest manhunt i've_ever seen.zero dark_thirty was directed by the same woman who made the hurt_locker and it felt twice as long and half as good it started strong but just slowly declined the big final with the attack on bin_laden compound was just not compelling and was anticlimactic i did find it interesting that the movie was somewhat anti obama because how he tied the hands of our cia i just surprised it was nominated of an oscar but lone_survivor was not.one of the most amazingly realistic films ever i went into this film thinking that they would have tried to make the hunt for bin_laden like a call of duty game however following the main_character maya through her struggles to hunt down the acclaimed terrorist was a powerful and interesting story all in all the acting writing and directing were all fantastic also the last half_hour is where the acting picks up the only issue i have with the film is the overall climax i understand that we don't_know much about bin_laden but the music or atmosphere created on that final scene should've been much more triumphant than it really is.the best film of 2012 kathryn_bigelow is so good at everything she does.standout jessica chastain9 10a masterpiece about finding and killing osama_bin ladena good but not great film.the best film of 2013 that should have won best picture in my_opinion the only reason it didn't win was a political one because of the torture scenes jessica_chastain gives a tremendous performance the last 45_minutes of the film will have you biting your nails and ready to chant usa some of the curveballs are too hot to handle and believability was not necessarily on the director's to do list but the gist of the story should resonate with most any american whether a patriot or a conspiracy theorist.quite frankly a bore fest.this movie was ok but it was just to uneventful the whole movie was just research questioning and a girl trying to convince everyone he is right there's to terrorist_attacks which each last like 30 seconds and at the end of the 2 and a half long movie the actual killing of bin_laden i was a bit disappointed with this movie just because i heard it was good and the killing bin_laden part was intense it wasn't in the least and was instead slow and dragged out just like the rest of the movie if your thinking of watching a true action movie go look somewhere else.kathryn bigelow takes on the post_9 11 world again after the hurt_locker with another compelling gritty muscular film about a very dirty war on terror.jessica chastain is outstanding as the raw but eager recruit who is thrown almost literally into a hellish scenario in the opening scenes as she has to participate in graphic and deeply unpleasant interrogations and torture these are played completely straight we're left in no doubt that it's a horrible horrible thing but the story is episodic unfolding over a decade and the final sequences of the navy_seals raid on osama_bin laden's compound are gripping in the extreme this is a fine film told brilliantly with top class performances all round but it did feel almost unutterably bleak there's no triumphalism there's almost no joy at all this war is a bad thing it makes people do very bad things and leaves us all more than little bit broken afterwards.brilliant and incredibly thoughtful zero_dark thirty is as intelligent as it is exciting featuring stellar editing and cinematography as well as a pitch perfect musical score by alexandre desplat the film succeeds admirably on a technical level ultimately though its intelligence is what makes it a great film underneath the intricate plot it's about a lot more than one would initially think.one of the most important events in american history delivered in a manner both dim and unwaveringly distant the audience is treated more as spectators watching spectators rather than being immersed in this story.movie is great this is only the 3rd movie i gave 5_stars the other 2 was good fellas scarface \\xc3\\xb0 started out quite good then rapidly turns to shit an excellent realistic depiction of the years long search for bin_laden and the one cia specialist that wouldn't let it go it's hard to follow at_times as they move fast and the names are difficult to make out but a great start performance by chastain make the whole thing work now i go to wikipedia to read about the real thing.i was in a new baby boy who loves to make sure that you are looking for the world of russia is going to make a baby boy who love to make a baby boy who loves to make a baby boy who loves to make a baby to make the same way to get to another country in which the process of russia is going through the world i have yet to make the fork lift work in the world of a new baby year old daughter is going on a result is the process to a result in a reality uhh if they have our opp in u7ihhja babythe most amazing feat was how bigelow managed to tell the story without glamourising any of it.while zero_dark thirty boasted impressive cinematography and technical elements a lack of a climax and character complexity made the film rather dull and disengaging.people have_been criticizing this movie because it implies that information gained from torture helped lead to bin_laden but so what i for one think it's totally unreasonable to say that torture contributed nothing in finding bin_laden the real question is was it worth it was compromising america's reputation by breaking international laws worth tracking down one of the most_wanted men in the world that's not something i can answer as a non american bin_laden meant no harm to my country and it wasn't my democratically elected administration that committed crimes against humanity hell i barely remember 9_11 future generations will look back on the work of katherine bigelow as not just great films but as records of the post_9 11 zeitgeist god i hate using that word definitely a slow burner feels like an extended episode of 24 for the first 3 4 with espionage torture and cia shenanigans apart from a few interesting mini set_pieces this really tests your patience and you start to feel as bored as some of the intelligence analysts you're watching like a pint of guinness it is just about worth the wait with the slow buildup almost justified by the final 40 mins where all the investment pays off for the characters and you the viewer oscar winning director kathryn_bigelow the hurt_locker is caught in a catch 22 making this film about the cia's hunt for osama_bin laden on the one hand she can mention the big break id of the personal courier that led to the hideout in abbottabad however she can't get into the level of detail on the subject or people involved rightfully so due to the sensitive and classified information that would cost us real lives and missions tonight bigelow is left in the unenviable position of having to tell this 10_year story from the perspective of a lone agency analyst maya and this is where the movie really suffers and drags maya's 100 certainty in a business of uncertainty intel is misplaced no one knew for sure who or what was in that compound beforehand thus potus decisive call i can't see any cia operative being pleased with how their profession is depicted as giving up dismissive or their collective success which is always the result of many being feted upon just one and the tier 1 forces pushing back on a potential obl mission is implausible along with their horseshoe game just prior to wheels up ufb civilians will welcome this movie with open arms and embrace the misrepresentation of our covert warriors down range because they don't_know any better and that's hollywood ideally a movie on current intelligence and military operations should never be made however this watered down movie will most assuredly be received by spec ops as a laughable yawner grade c starts out slow but eventually picks up half way into the movie.dark tense realistic and boasting spectacular performances zero_dark thirty brings the greatest_manhunt in history to the big screen in a spectacular way.great movie overall good action and based_on a true_story of the search for osama_bin ladena movie you'll love if you look up to this men that have courage like every hero should have men who i would like to be.an american classic truly a film for the ages and more than deserves to be remembered as one.one of the worst films i have ever seen.ahhh the way act of valor should've beeni don't like to watch a movie with a torture scene in it makanya pas awal awal scene ada adegan macam begini kok jadi males nonton tp karena penasaran thdp review orang orang yg bilang memuji akting jessica_chastain maka lanjutlah keinginan untuk menonton film ini susah untuk mentracking orang teroris ya iyalahh penyelidikan harus dimulai dr 7 tahun yang lalu itupun cuma ketangkep bawahan bawahannya aja semacam orang orang yang membiayai financer messenger etc kinda like detective but far more dangerous and difficult karena harus ngerti bahasa lokal dan kebiasaan orang orang timur tengah itu yang paling menegangkan pas mau penggerebekan rumah osama_bin laden like really emosi aktor2nya bisa ngebawa kita kedalam situasi yang tegang x another well_done for kathryn bigelow.the true_story of one woman's passion to bring obl to justice.pretty decent movie.i liked the realism even_though the character of maya was invented but i would have preferred the shooting of bin_laden to have_been handled a little differently i would have liked a more direct camera angle with slow_motion and instant replay from several angles and points of view maybe one from the bullet if i'm alone in thinking that though i'll be quiet.kathryn bigelow is the only female director i've_ever liked is it misogyny so what i'm paying an unusual tribute to bilegow's work she deserves it more than any other female director and more than many guys well_done madam i'm waiting for your next movie now.mark boal has a serious eye for telling telling a story journalistic and well the film is perfect in the way it captures the idea of modern_warfare one of the year's very best aone of the greatest true stories i've_ever seen i was seriously appalled when jessica_chastain did not win an oscar for her amazing performance.a film about the hunt for and killing of osama_bin laden that manages not to be american propaganda is quite an achievement one that asks whether it was all even worth it is something else entirely zero_dark thirty is gripping to the nail bitingly tense end despite that we all know what happens all carried by an outstanding jessica chastain.amazing.long but well worth it in the end the movie isn't made much differently than any other political drama so don't except to be blown away with style taking you inside the prisoner interrogation camps was a nice way to start the movie but the second hour drags along with the detective work involved in hunting down osama_bin laden it was nice to see it all come together in the end the final 40_minutes where they send the seals team into pakistan is really fantastic this is definitely the most interesting way this subject_matter could have_been presented dull at_times but very educational.not as interesting as the hurt_locker but has its moments.full review soon it is great words cannot explain how disappointing this film was exceedingly boring and stereotypical explosion scenes seen in any action flick some true stories don't need a movie and this is a prime example.probably my_favorite film of 2012 i thought this was better_than argo jessica_chastain's acting in here is superb i was glad this film was not super political either relative to other hollywood films overrated and long piece of propaganda.one of my favorites of 2012 one of those films you want to watch to understand the story but like many others not one to watch again and again gripping story line towards the end as the cast enter the compound acting and direction good watchable film nothing overly special.this is a good movie jessica_chastain is amazing in the film she can pass the strength of her character zero_dark thirty is one of 2012 s best films thanks to superb performances clever writing crisp directing and one of the best climaxes in recent memory.eh ok i guess given the subject_matter there were probably many ways this film could have gone very wrong it's worth_watching i guess it tells the story given the subject_matter and what hollywood can do with big budgets and great actors and film crews i would have liked to have watched something better the story kinda deserves it but this will do it has it's moments the best part the ending could have_been a little brighter.the narrative more resembles a documentary than it does a drama and that's not at all a bad thing in this case.why why does everyone love this movie so much i don't get itloved it all the way up to the actual assault on ubl's compound then the whole movie grinds to a halt almost the last_30 minutes are unbearable in how slow it all becomes and how it lacks authenticity they should've asked the guys from act of valor to step in for those bitsbigelow made a race against time and the end result couldn't be attribute to her if we put her earlier work in to perspective the final operation to capture obl gives fictitious events to what actually had happened from start to end it is evident the movie is a race against time.it could have_been a classic if the movie would have_been made few years later and at_least with somewhat near actual_events that took_place at pakistan.this movie is more boring than church it's also propaganda and a fucking lie well at_least that's my_opinion i only rented it because i thought i'd get to see navy_seals blow shit up too bad i had to wait through two hours of crap before it even happened.too long there was plenty that could have_been edited out.thrilling and disturbing drama with a tremendous pace will have you thinking the whole time until the exciting climaxits dense and demanding of the audience but zero_dark thirty is a though provoking thriller with superb acting.great performances but i wanted to see a little more of that manhunt the marketing promised.kathryn bigelow consistently overrated her style is straightforward and precise so there are no real missteps but it never excels like the greats either also when you know how the story ends it's a little anti climactic.great movie into seeing the closest most americans will get to what really happened yet unfortunately un climatic.instant classic war moviefantastic insight gripping zero_dark thirty tells the story of a woman who doesn't give up until she gets her man and we don't even need to go into the realm of spoilers when we say that she does get him there's plenty of suspense in the story and lots of grit in our heroine i'd call it a must_see film.a tv crime drama stretched out into a two and a half_hour movie that only keeps you awake with the periodical suicide bombing the film's main_character maya is one of the least appealing protagonists i've_seen in a while her character has an attitude that says give me what i want or i'll kick and scream until i get it and quite frankly doesn't come off as a person who would be able to hold a job with any government institution in this role chastain proves that today's definition of excellent acting is being able to yell at a shaky_cam during a closeup furthermore the film consists of cheap symbolism ultra nationalistic motifs and absurdly dismissable side characters a close up of maya lifting up her burka to reveal chuck taylor converses really you can tell that bigelow or perhaps her producers tried to keep this movie apolitical but the islamic characters in this movie are so flat that they seem as inanimate as the desert itself which ends up making the torture scenes rather mundane and unmoving you feel worst for the pet monkeys than the detainee stuffed inside a box finally in the last twenty minutes it turns into call of duty the movie and things actually get mildly interesting in a suspenseful raid that makes the seal's operation look as well planned as a friday night at the bars coincidence that 80 of the trailer footage for this movie was clips from the last scene i think not.could have_been more graphic what i expected trashupdated review zero_dark thirty is a suspenseful edge of your_seat thriller about the greatest man hunt in history best film of 2012 jessica chastains is amazing go america chastain nailed her role seemed to be a tad long with action only coming in the end but still a phenomenal moviepretty gripping thriller based_on true events probably one of the biggest news stories of our era and was directed very well although i understand the darkness of the film but it was difficult to see what was happening.quite a flat movie the story is interesting and also the fact that it shows how us has used tortures which everybody but some us citizens already knew but not much more than that.the third_act storyline saved this movie.awesome film real or not.film looks promising.muy intensa profunda e interesante incluso si le falta algo m\\xc3\\xa1s de chispa.thoroughly riveting brilliantly informative together with chastain's mesmerizing performance zero_dark thirty easily makes it into my all time favorites list.i enjoyed it however some of the historical facts seem to have_been distorted for dramatic effect.astonishingly smart.the film takes its time to get to the point which is what all films should be aloud to do.watch homeland instead this is a great work the movie revealed what everyone wanted to know jessica_chastain made a good job images as well as sounds are perfect.smart and tense retelling of the hunt for osama_bin laden from director kathryn_bigelow it's mostly a cast of unknown with kyle_chandler chris_pratt and james_gandolfini as the most famous faces in supporting roles besides the story i was also interested in the politics surrounding the film liberals condemned the film as being military porn and an apologist piece for bush cheney torture policies conservatives condemned the film as being an election year commercial for the obama administration finally getting osama after watching the film my feeling is that the film was fairly neutral and was more simply reporting what_happened from a ground level view there are no politicians show in the film cia board meetings are about as high as things go in terms of politics if the film managed to offend people on both_sides that's probably a pretty good indication that the filmmakers got it right.good movie complicated but really good.a bit long but still good this is what defeat looks like bro your jihad is over that line sums up what i originally thought of this film i thought of it as little more than a fist pumping pro america flick with a little moral ambiguity thrown in to appease the critics after watching however i must say i was far off the mark very far off in truth zero_dark thirty disappointed me not because it was bad but because i wanted to hate it i went into this thinking this is going to be nothing more than a piece of trashy propaganda and i was already writing a scathing review in my head how wrong i was not only is zero_dark thirty one of the best films of 2012 but it realistically portrays the hunt for bin_laden in a way that is shocking and occasionally hard to watch but necessary to truly understand the ideology behind both_sides yes one could criticise the film for it's obvious scenes of torture but then one would also have to disregard the fact that only when torture was abandoned did they find bin_laden yes you can criticise the fillm's nittier grittier aspects but in doing so you would only be denying yourself the whole picture and kathryn_bigelow presents this picture with intelligence style and a stunning eye for detail the plot while you most likely know the basics is absolutely compelling jessica_chastain plays maya a c.i.a operative in the middle_east who has devoted her life to finding the man responsible for blowing up the twin towers the film is broken up into various chapters each detailing an important event in the hunt making a complicated story easier to understand though not at the expense of any intrigue or importance funnily aside from maya no character seems truly important to the film though i guess that is what one could attribute to translating such an epic event to film anyway the plight of any other characters are secondary anyway as this film is the maya show first and foremost every event good or bad morally justifiable or sketchy is seen through maya's eyes which skews much of what one would usually be firmly for or against but due to the style of filmmaking as well as chastain's fantastic performance the perceptive bias is necessary in affirming the film's power if this doesn't read enough like a plot synopsis let me assure you it isn't due to any faults in the film's narrative but rather the fact that a key ingredient in the film is the notion of perception is reality as i said maya is our eyes in the film and her experience translates to our own making for an overreaching narrative that with such a grand scope is difficult to quantify positives even if you dislike the film's premise and i know many people took isse with it you cannot deny the mastery of her craft that bigelow displays here she does a great job at keeping the surprise factor high two of the three notable explosion scenes made me jump while also managing to keep the viewer interested in what could have_been mind numbing scenes of detective work desk work and diplomatic conferences bigelow adds this pulsing intrigue to the film as though we need to keep watching and that is the highest praise one can give to a film to say that a film must be watched is the highest praise i can think of of course not all the acclaim for the film's brilliant atmosphere and pace should go to ms bigelow the cast do a fantastic job despite everyone feeling secondary to jessica_chastain's show stealing performance jason_clarke as the veteran c.i.a worker provides a fantastic character for viewers to either love or hate one can despise his ruthless interrogation of prisoners but admire his essentially friendly and occasionally goofy demeanour that is another aspect of the film that i found riveting the moral ambiguity while it may be cliched one can't_help but feel angry when dan jason clarke's character after brutally torturing a prisoner complains when his pet monkeys are taken away this two sided nature one found in most of the film's characters is just another facet that makes the film so intriguing again though nothing can top chastain's performance she brings a lovable nature to a character that could under a different microscope be seen as a terrible person that is something to notice throughout the film characters that could have_been seen as cruel or inhumane in any other setting are often seen as perfectly normal even likable characters in this film this gives further credence to the film's ideal of perception is reality and is displayed in a number of ways with the eating of food being one that stuck out for me throughout the film we often see characters eating food and for some reason that in my eyes humanised them somehow as it is something that filmmakers don't always focus on the eating of food does a lot to make characters seem real in a film that could easily be seen as unemotional or detached a subtle movement like licking peanut butter off a knife transformed maya from cold unrealistic character into a more endearing one caught up in events that no normal person should while retaining the characteristics that make her human in the first place one more aspect that hugely helped out the film's tone was the music is it just me or is andre desplat everywhere these days if you haven't heard of him look him up on the internet and the amount of mainstream films he has composed the score for in the last few years will blow you away anyway it is no different in zero_dark thirty the music effortlessly shifting from a sleek pulsing rhythm a la drive to a haunting middle eastern call a la assassin's creed adds to the atmosphere of action scenes such as those in the middle of the film and it's gut wrenching final shot flaws in a film as divisive as zero_dark thirty it is hard to decipher what could be a legitimate gripe what could be a personal bias and where one makes the distinction to deal with such a problem i'm going to list off everything that i personally found to be a grievance the blunt approach first of all i felt the film started off very weak of course i went in with the intention of criticism but i genuinely feel the opening was poor i'm not criticising the opening black screen over the sound of 9_11 but rather the event immediately following dan with maya watching on and two goons to help tortures a prisoner for information now while i understand that such a scene is important in setting the film's tone in building the characters and making the distinction between events early and late in the film maya is initially revolted by torture only to realise it's seeming importance in the second act only to abandon it in the final act etc but the scene feels so forced and awkward to watch especially in comparison to the masterful later scenes that i can't_help but feel as though this scene was introduced to make the critics and perhaps the political goons sweat that being said the more the film continues the better it gets especially the highly emotional ending shot so the opening awkwardness is more than made up for another flaw that wouldn't be attributed to the film's political reception is it's overwhelming detail now i wouldn't be so crude as to say that there is too much going on for a viewer to feasibly enjoy but a lot does go down throughout the film and that makes it a bit difficult to keep track of the various plot threads to be found i could blame this on the fact that we see everything through maya making for a less over arching and more personal touch but that does hinder the great amount of events that are introduced during the film in closing zero_dark thirty is a powerhouse a film that takes a somewhat amoral stance on hot button topics while crafting an intense emotional and unforgettable tale while it may divide viewers as to the worth of the filmmakers ideology's one cannot deny the huge production value fantastic score and powerhouse performances coming together to produce an amazing thrilling account on the story that everyone_knows but doesn't know final grade a really intense movie that stayed with me for many days having friends there perhaps made it so impactful.sorry but this movie is simply tasteless and disgusting ms.bigelow seem to have overcome her zenith long long ago.can't believe i waited so long to see it.assuming the first_half doesn't lull you to sleep the movie really picks up in the second_half the whole movie feels like foreplay compared to the last thirty minutes but it makes the raid at the end that much more enjoyable.wow i was thoroughly unimpressed last 10 minutes were sweet though it's detailed to a fault but there's no doubting it's pitch perfect lead the tough as nails jessica chastain.gripping intriguing and a very well told story that i never knew was so based_on luck and one single lead.one of the best movies of 2013 love the end scene amovie kept_me on the edge at every scene especially the ending worth_watching again and again.tense well directed and featuring a powerful jessica_chastain performance to lock it down the two and a half_hour run time of zero_dark thirty flies by surprisingly quickly.it is very interesting to get a glimpse into the world of government intelligence and spies fighting terrorism this is a world the public never sees and cannot understand through the lens of news reports even if it is not a perfect account some changes are necessary and it is still very believable it also holds good tension and is interesting throughout this is especially impressive considering the ending is common knowledge and holds no surprises a movie like this makes you appreciate how incredibly difficult it is to find an international fugitive when he is so protected by people with such strong religious convictions and extreme hate for their enemy it does an excellent job of avoiding a bias towards republican or democratic parties still it responsibly explains how torture is necessary in situations like these kathryn_bigelow is a skilled director everything feels very real from the toned_down but still ugly torture scenes to assignation attempts to the speed and precision of the final raid the entire cast is good but jessica_chastain stands out in particular she represents the dedication resolve of the cia and homeland security workers to bring osama_bin laden to justice.one of the 2013 s best tourer scenes were incredible to bad they got the wrong guy.gripping incredibly tense and with almost perfect detail depicting the needle in a haystack capture of osama_bin laden.hour and a half build_up to a 15 minute scene not what you'd expect at all boringly long with really no action.from kathryn_bigelow director of the hurt_locker and strange days comes a film about the real_life woman who was at the heart of the hunt for osama_bin laden.this part biopic part war movie part cia thriller is far more historically culturally and intellectually entertaining than it is suspensefully entertaining so those of you who were expecting an action thriller along the lines of bigelow's previous film will be somewhat disappointed all the same this happens to be my_favorite of her films to date.indeed it does have some great shock moments although those of you who watched the news at all in the last 12 years or so may not find very many plotpoints at all that surprising and the character_development of the story's lead protagonist maya as well as lead actress jessica_chastain's portrayal of her in terms of craftsmanship are spot on the acting deep characters and intriguing plot alone are enough to keep one's attention let alone begelow's practically iconic film style of obscuring money shots and increasing the tension of a scene with dialogue rather than on screen action.trailer made it look like it was going to be awesome tried to play it up like it was going to be act of valor fell short very short move was way too_long boring should be entitled zero stars thirty the most dramatic but the most realistic movie.i don't necessarily believe the film to be 100 factual even abiding for artistic licence however the film is well shot and kept_me hookedgood because it's true and shows what happened.jessica chastain's character_development was great but what about the other characters hmm however set aside that fact and we have a realistic intelligent and by the end suspenseful movie.i will indeed watch this film again i might purchase a blu ray copy of this.just superb excellent thumbs up for kathryn bigelowthe film is amazingly well made features some great performances is tense and intresting and has one hell of a climax it can be a bit heavy handed at_times though feeling too scattered with it's broad scope it's a good movie but not a perfect one.absolutely riveting heart pounding politically accuratefull review soonback when this was nominated for best picture this was my_favorite film of the awards season as time has passed i know hold lincoln in higher regards but that does not change how excellent this film is kathryn_bigelow and mark_boal deliver a true_story that captured the attention of the world and showcase an intensity that even exceeds the hurt_locker in zero_dark thirty viewers get to experience the intelligence side of things in the search for osama_bin laden while this film is not filled with violence it still pulls you in as maya played by jessica_chastain closes in on the notorious al'qaeda leader the liberties taken by the cia the portrayal of water_boarding and finally the raid itself are all things that keep you engaged the raid itself takes up the last_30 minutes of the film and it is worth_watching it does not rely on stunning visual effects or intense music but on the enormity of the situation to drive it home for viewers everything is pulled together by jessica_chastain who gives a refreshingly believable and intense performance as maya.this is the outcome of responsible film making every element is present throughout zero_dark thirty's elongated yet somehow brisk run time.extreme acts of valor and patriotism are displayed in this film works wella fascinating account of the search for osama_bin laden from the perspective of the cia seems to run quicker than it's nearly 3 hour runtime despite the length i thought the film still failed to develop any of the characters relieving the film of any tension that might have pushed it into greatness as it stands the film it is still entertaining as basically a historical reenactment.there was too much of a documentary feel to it but it was a very well made documentary in that regard for me it was just lacking the emotion to make it a truly terrific film interestingly it wasn't until the last half_hour or so when it finally started to get me on the edge of my seat.this was well made indeed yet extremely slow at_times the last 45_minutes is what i wished the entire movie would feel like hence a very flawed film i cannot think of anything that would have made this film better i loved it.jessica chastain is the new julia roberts with less teeth very suspenseful account of one of the biggest manhunts in history funny how the writer director duo won a best picture w the hurt_locker when this film blows that out of the water didnt like how it portrays that only 1 person in the movie actually cared about justice.what defines this film is its controversial depiction of torture but what it unearths is much more harrowing and heroic than terrifying the story revolves around cia_agent maya who aims to finish a decades long manhunt for osama_bin laden while stationed in pakistan starting in 2003 critics are inarguably split on whether they believe the torture depicted in this film is shown as essential in the capture of wanted terrorists or an accurate portrayal of torture tactics in all their inhumane glory the characters in the film certainly feel that torturing detainees helps in the process but it's left vague whether the filmmaker supports this tactic the story is entertaining on its own merit helped by the ferocious performance of chastain and the unraveling of the mystery right before our eyes the intricacy of bin_laden's extraction at the hands of the navy seal_team was especially interesting to watch and was supposedly very truthful in its depiction there's an emotional component for anyone imbibed in post_9 11 dialogue but there's also entertainment in the planning and investigation behind the scenes.any movie where you know how it's going to end and still manages to be suspenseful is the sign of a great filmmaker kathryn_bigelow has crafted a tense masterpiece and one of the great movies of our times.much of the high rating comes with the movie's last half_hour a real time reenactment of the execution of the 21st century's most_wanted criminal even_though the movie's conclusion was forgone the events leading_up to that conclusion helped in keeping the suspense and the threat.while i didn't have an issue with the depiction of torture in the movie there were two other issues i had the first is the subplot dealing with the cia's hope to flip a doctor in al_qaeda while the results of that dealing led to the emotional resolve to continue the story for our characters the setup and execution of that part was unsubtle and telegraphed the second issue i had was with jessica_chastain's continued mispronunciation of the name ahmed it's not akmed it's ah med that's why there's an h in the name not a k or a ch for someone supposedly in the intelligence business who knows the language the character should have known better it's those details that like with flaws in military presentation in the hurt_locker take away from the realism of stories that are marketed as realistic.a very interesting film from a historical point of view but way too much violence and way too_long for me to ever want to watch it again only hollyweird could condense a decades work by thousands of unsung heros into a two and a half_hour movie having said that its a pretty good film.gritty thrilling and masterfully directed zero_dark thirty draws in the audience with the premise of the largest manhunt in history and keeps us watching with jessica_chastain's presence and kathryn_bigelow's direction.thriller and great to know the truth behind the osama_bin laden hunt jessica_chastain was great conflicted driven devastatedslow built but entertaininga somber competent honest and compelling depiction of a difficult topic.simply excellent this film does the near impossible and lives up to all of it's hype kathyrn bigelow has brough an intense gritty realistic film that is one of if not the best movie of 2012 jessica_chastain owns the screen in this docu drama about the hunt for the man behind the attacks of 9_11 the first_half hour of this film pretty much consists of the brutal torture of detainees an interesting choice was to not let the audience know what these_men had done that earned their capture or ensuing torture you do feel your heart go out to these_men although they are probably keeping secrets that could cost many innocent people their_lives jason_clarke plays the main interrogator and you wonder what this guy's home life is like let's just say i wouldn't want to be this guy's dog when it poops on the family rug enter chastain's maya who quickly becomes obsessed with finding osama after one of her colleagues is blown up by a suicide bomber she is laser focused on this goal even if her superior is not protect the homeland he tells her the key is finding osama's courier and then following him to the location of his employer even after the compound is found there is a lot of uncertainty if bin_laden is even there the guy doesn't exactly come out to get the mail 100 some days pass before maya is able to convince her superiors to send a raid to the location the raid itself is portrayed as a deliberate room to room clearing with some unfortunate collateral damage i guess mama was right when she said watch out who you become involved with chris_pratt shows up as one of the navy_seals playing a variation of a meathead jock soldier who doesn't bat an eye at gunning down an unarmed woman the first_half of the movie is a little hard to follow there are a lot of foreign sounding names that are tough to keep straight grade 7.5the story we know told in a way that feels new and exciting it doesn't pull punches in supporting torture or using bribery to get what is needed and that adds a level of earnestness to the movie.bigelow's immense talent for realistically tense war scenes makes her non combat scenes feel jadedmeticulous story telling and powerful performances.ok storyline a bit slow until the real manhunt begins.if you want to show how stupid american decision makers are you don't need to write a stupid screenplay the main_character was the only well written one.this would have_been much better as a docu drama as it is it's seriously dull.propagande ou pas ce film est tr\\xc3\\xa8s bien ficel\\xc3\\xa9 avec une forte intrigue et du suspense \\xc3\\xa0 en revendre.politically smart it treats the entire subject as mundane be it water_boarding someone or infighting in the government this creates a disturbing atmosphere that is riveting from start to finish.though it's a dramatized version of real_life events it bears enough similarities to reality as far as being a taut expertly made thriller goes it's incredibly effective chastain gives a determined performance as our lead and received a richly deserved oscar nod.more like one good scene 42 a movie so wrapped up in political bullshit that the us ministry of propaganda more or less wrote the entire script how do we really know what's actually going on out there because the fact is we don't_know the half of it and almost everything featured here is based entirely on ifs buts and maybes drip fed from what the media spurts out making this more of an opinion based affair than modern day historical truth annoying underhanded story aside that links together terrible human evens for the sake the movie's plot with one sole perpetrator dr evil laden acting like the mother ship in a sci fi alien attack flick what exactly has this got going for it well the main_character is a single minded one note government agent on the hunt for bin larden and that's all she is same as every other character featured they're all what they do for a living and nothing more there's practically no depth to any of them and by the time laden's ugly looking hideout is raided and his super hi tec 1990 s computers and video cassettes are gathered together i'd more or less had my fill of us style manufactured history but at_least they were honest about the helicopter that the super trained team managed to crash into thin air before killing the unarmed suspect that's at_least something bigelow needs to step away from politics and make something fun and enjoyable to watch because this is whitewashing by numbers and that's a very boring game to play.i probably liked it because i liked the source material more but the film was certainly intense and inevitably the climax was the best part of the film.overall i think zero_dark thirty was a good movie with a great cast i understand why this movie was not voted top nominated pictures of 2012 because it dragged and took forever to get to the point pratt and egelton were only depicted for the last_30 minutes of the flick although pratt's character's comments was highly commercialized promoted the movie on another note being based_on true events i don't believe the cia ever caught bin_laden in this fashion it seemed staged and bigalow was thrown to the wolves to show the public the heroism of our_government officials trying to capture a highly publicized terrorist it was good to watch once unlike hurt_locker now that's a better movie from the same director that at_least won some awards.good old fashioned cia kick ass movie you live the story as you go through the high and lows with maya.it's a film based_on facts the facts being either substantial or too played out.well its good to witness but nothing close to a masterpiece kathryn_bigelow seems to be full of herself while directing.while not always flawless in consistency and pace zero_dark thirty will leave a chillingly foul taste in your mouth.the beginning i found boring but it picked up in the middle the ending was worth the waita lot of layers in this film that's for sure certainly have to give props to kathryn bigerow for her gustiness in choosing to directing a film that encompasses so many areas of debate the film may have some small flaws but overall i think the film's fearlessness is what makes it fresh.i wish i could really tell you more about this movie but then i'd have to kill you kidding outstanding homage to the men and women in intelligence analysis and ops if you work i the ic you're in for a ride.definitely not up to the hypein 2011 osama_bin laden was killed by navy s.e.a.l team and america danced in the streets in zero_dark thirty we see how this came to be through the eyes of a cia_agent analyst maya jessica_chastain and while the main story is about finding bin_laden we also get to see a story of pure obsession and with jessica_chastain's pale weary no nonsense maya we also get an excellent performance the movie suffers a bit of the political influence the movie got greenlight about a month or something after bin_laden was killed and it is quite lenghty but with the sudden change of storytelling in the third_act breaks the analytic thriller and turns in to a showcase of modern_warfare where soldiers take 30 second breaks to tell others who they killed it is both sad and interesting thing to see.but in the end zero_dark thirty shows that while in a grand scale killing bin_laden was an achievement in personal scale it ended the 10_year manhunt and also purpose for some people's very existance.exciting and interesting 9 20 13 after all of the hype i was rather disappointed when i saw this film it is pretty slow and everyone_knows what is going to happen i also know a lot of the more specific details too so it was just like going through the motions as i watched it the beginning kept my attention with the interrogation scenes and they do seem very realistic follow this the film slows down tremendously the actual raid at the end also has some tension and is pretty well_done this only saved the film from being a total dud though.haunting compelling agonisingly suspenseful and just awesomeshit was boringgggg great story telling and actingpeople keep saying the torture methods are controversial even_though it is obvious the cia uses these tactics and overall this controversy is only used to weigh down this awesome movie the explosions and fighting are realistic and the journey to find bin_laden is epic.fantastic the details kathryn_bigelow puts into her movies puts her up at the top of her game though it didn't win best picture it was up against argo it was definitely worthy of its nomination also jessica chastian's performance is perfect going from a meek shy personnel to a determined powerhouse that garnered the respect of those around her another masterpiece that reminds me how much i love the art of movie making.it was ok worth watchinga good film that i can recommend but it is a little overrated and overlong the acting is outstanding as it was in the hurt_locker i'm not gonna lie the last act i couldn't see what was going on it was way way to dark and when bin_laden was killed i didn't even realize they had killed him.god bless the united_states of americai was a great film but braver men behind this true_story this is one true great film superbly directed and acted.well directed by kathryn_bigelow male gigolo not patriotic nonsense like black_hawk down or fucking lone_survivor fuck lone_survivor very gritty very well done.horrible nasty little film from the agents disappointed looks when they hear they aren't allowed to torture anymore right up to jessica_chastain's almost orgasmic looks when seeing a dead body at the end how this was an oscar nominated film i don't knowamazing work of fiction.jessica chastain bravissinma regia e sceneggiatura da applausi.loved it merica babybigelow the director of 2009 s best picture winner the hurt_locker directed another suspenseful film under the war genre with about the same style and smart but no better_than her previous film as this contains more affective content that may've brought the level down a little although the film on the greatest_manhunt in history was very well made especially the performances of chastin with clarke supporting her as they've done their best yet the film may not be better_than the hurt_locker at its maximum rating but it can't get lower than its own minimum rating as this is an absolute 4 star film b full review coming soon interesting but very slow kathryn_bigelow has a knack for making tense situations using wonderful cinematic techniques greig fraser's cinematography gives not only spectacular visuals but a dark look that gives us a sense of solemn undertone leading the film is jessica_chastain who truly gives us a journey from the beginning to the end and everything in between she holds nothing back her emotional range within the film can be attributed to the wonderful script by mark_boal and ms chastain's portrayal kathryn_bigelow has created another war movie classic and though it may run itself a bit long and lose it's pacing at_times it makes up for it with some intense sequences and wonderful acting.galvanizing accurate tense and thoughtful zero_dark thirty confirms kathryn_bigelow's position as hollywood's leading director for modern war cinema.the ending of the movie saved it but honestly i don't_know how people could enjoy the first 2 hours it's interesting for a bit but eventually it just feels boring and forced when it does eventually get to the raid it's very thrilling and very realistic but it takes way too_long to get to that point jessica_chastain is in no way deserving of the amount of praise she is receiving her performance is mediocre at best and the very last shot of the film without spoiling anything is so cheesy it hurts.zero dark_thirty is dark and perfectly acted bigelow should have got an academy_award nomination.the absolute best movie i've_seen in years jessica_chastain was amazing the entire cast should be applauded i don't care if this really happened or not it is a movie first and foremost and they were spectacular.tense with a very strong cast unmissablethere's 2 hours and 37 minutes of my life i'll never get back that was one of the most boring movies_i've ever watched and only served to reinforce my disbelief of the entire story.slow start and long but with a loo break and fresh beer out the fridge it was pretty good.absolutely amazing movie chastain is simply brilliant usually movies with the topic of bloodshed can be redundant but zero_dark thirty surprised me and surpassed the norm for its genre a riveting inside view of what really happened that day.this movie will keep u glued to the screen even tho you know what the ending will be.decent movie at recreating hunt for osama i disagree with critics torture is just 2 of what detainees might be subjected to for information what else a girl like maya is expected to say than i'm all right since it is routine for her shes not a human rights campaigner for un.after having been supremely let down by the seemingly politically charged over hyped and over dramatized the hurt_locker then after hearing the controversy about the use of torture in zero_dark thirty i was not too keen on putting myself through another 2.5 hour opinion by a subjective director and feeding the machine however after forcing myself to look at the film objectively the reality is kathryn_bigelow has produced a beautifully directed dramatization of the efforts from 9_11 to the death of ubl the opening scene as it were was very powerful opening the film with the calls fears and chaos during 9_11 was the perfect way to put the entire audience in the right frame of mind and while the facts may have had some dramatic license taken for the sake of filmmaking i've read that it is remarkably accurate as for the controversy around the torture scenes i didn't watch the film believing that kathryn_bigelow was making a statement of the effectiveness of torture in finding ubl it simply came across as the beginning of a series of steps that got us closer and closer to solving this long cold case i intentionally didn't read too much about the controversy or kathryn's response to the criticism until after i formed my own opinion what i found is that her intent is exactly how i took it it wasn't meant to convey torture's effectiveness it was simply meant to convey its role in the process while there were a couple of scenes that made me cringe a little from its over dramatic stance overall zero_dark thirty is a remarkable improvement over her previous effort and one of the best of the year.best ever one of my_favorite sastonishing brilliantly scripted acted and directed two women deserve all the praise and those are kathryn_bigelow and jessica chastain.it started off intriguing but ended up having the same boring style and pace as the hurt_locker it's just another propaganda film first and only viewing 10 10 2014 a detail examination of the methods and processes that led to the location and subsequent killing of osama_bin laden i believe they could have cut 30 mins of it and it would have_been a greater movie some scenes were unnecessary so sometimes the movie felt dragging by any means this is a bad movie though it's actually a good movie but could have_been great if it was more concise and precise b interesting watch well directed and acted.loved this movie see it maya jessica_chastain slightly irritated so what does this baluchi guy look like abu_faraj al libbi yoav levi tall long white beard thin walks with a cane maya jessica_chastain smirks kinda like gandalf abu_faraj al libbi yoav levi who this is not really my genre of film and i've had this on my tivo queue for the longest time because this film had such good press during the academy awards but i couldn't bring myself to watch it so obviously finally i did and it was actually great i mean beside the all too real and gritty torture scene everything else was interesting i have a new found respect for the people whose job it is to do this from the interrogators the soldiers and down even to the pencil pushers sitting behind a desk knowing that they are working in a country so volatile that sh t can just hit the fan at any moment how does anyone work like that the entire cast was amazing and performed so convincingly that i completely forgot they were actors they all just embodied each of their role so completely that they were the characters they portrayed in the film no question about it i've always loved jessica_chastain as an actress from the first film i ever watched her in the debt she just has that enigmatic presence jason_clarke who played dan was superb he was definitely scary i wouldn't want to get on that guy's bad side the rest of the cast was equally awesome kyle_chandler joseph bradley jennifer_ehle jessica harold perrineau jack simon abkarian the detainee in the beginning of the film all simply amazing performances this was totally gripping and the final scenes were just mind blowing the details the planning the execution and the way the soldiers collected the data and sorted it was just wild wow also mad props to director kathryn_bigelow granted this film wasn't as good as the hurt_locker but she does have fresh and unique directing style that i'm fast becoming a fan of overall the film was very interesting just the military procedures in the end alone was engaging enough to tune in for but the rest of the process was also educational definitely worth another viewing if ever it comes on the telly.i would say too soon but this film would be insensitive and inappropriate at any time the only saving grace is that there is an actual strong female lead who does not fall into any of the predictable strong female lead cookie cutter character types.dramatic portrayal of true_story chastain is excellent though sequence of events is a bit disjointed this is the type of film that could be watched on numerous home viewings in the background positive trait in my case just to pick three other movies of the same genre to make a point while kathryn_bigelow's zero_dark thirty shares its objectives as a historical drama with such fine projects as charlie wilson's war of 2007 and two of its 2012 oscar contemporaries argo and lincoln it ends up in a class by itself when it comes to coverage style balance and appeal for depth of research and a script that overcomes the challenge of narrating current affairs without losing their dramatic appeal it works hard and is quite sincere the way it moves is heavier and more muted hence more effective leaving more for personal reflection on such topics as the brutality of interrogation techniques havoc of terrorism and war and the work of unsung heroes hats off to the three ladies at the center of this project lead actress jeessica chastain for how she plays cia_agent maya as poignantly as the mother mrs o'brien in terrence malick's tree of life of 2011 director kathryn_bigelow for once_again hitting it out of the park as she did with hurt_locker of 2009 and with k 19 the widowmaker of 2002 one of my favorites and co producer megan ellison tech giant oracle founder larry ellison's daughter for founding annapura pictures which is committed to serious cinema whose other recent projects include the master of 2012 how much of maya is fiction vs fact and one person vs composite will remain classified for a while but one of the interviews with the navy_seals does attest the veracity of the character as shown as someone who went after the mission with a single minded sense of purpose and dedication just to ponder the way oscars work of the four movies we started out with argo scores the least on my card for a total against the criteria listed and yet it is the only winner go figure great story about the hunt for bin_laden zero_dark thirty is not a film about the mission to kill osama_bin laden but instead it is a fine study of how such an objective turns one naive woman into a ruthless individual who won't let anything get in her way.while not exactly a fun movie to watch this is definitely one of the most powerful films i have seen.super intense and brilliantly produced film and one of the best of 2013 great musical score the acting was excellent and the end of ubl priceless s must movie to see.i had been waiting all year to see this movie and i wasn't disappointed i actually saw it last month but had to drive up to la to see it i couldn't wait for it to come to san diego what i found interesting is after the movie i thought to myself why would the cia allow some of this information to go public then the very next day i heard leon panetta was very upset with some of the content of the movie so i figured if the director of the c.i.a is upset then it must have_been pretty accurate the movie is long but it goes by so quickly if anyone else wins this year for best actress besides jessica_chastain it's rigged she was phenomenal it's funny to see her go from the character in the help to this character this clearly was one of the best movies i saw for 2012 although i'm not sure i'm going to say it was the best right now for me it's tied for first we'll see what happens at the oscars golden globes.i highly_recommend seeing this one very well directed gritty.it may not be the most accurate story but you sure do feel the urgency and tension in this film.a riveting drama that gives great detail to the finding of osama_bin laden this is a film that is not meant to entertain but rather inform but the last_30 minutes of the movie riveting the rest ok.kathryn bigelow's engaging story about the greatest_manhunt in history is very well directed and contains a knockout performance from jessica_chastain it is a lengthy film and it does drag in places but honestly nothing felt like it could be left out of the movie but the intensity definitely reduces in some places however the final_30 minutes or so are an example of masterfully suspenseful film making even_though you know the movie is going to end you can't_help but feel the intensity of the situation the movie is fascinating and intense for the most part but only mildly suffers due some dragging moments in the length but the end payoff makes it mostly worth it.a very good interpretation on what they claimed to have happened.just like the hurt_locker bigelow does her best to thrill with documentary style filmmaking incorporated with realistic drama but desperately falls to a lifeless void screaming for awards she had the chance to make a film about something so grand and i don't see what difference it would have made if she followed the entire hunt for years with a phone camera this is dead from start to finish just like bin laden.just couldn't get into this movie the first_half hour was all about torturing some guy and i didn't get past that.with literally classified historical and political accuracy zero_dark thirty pens the renowned narrative of osama_bin laden's assassination with all the precision and none of the cultural fanfare native to the issues and persons at hand naive depictions of torture mark the film's only shortcoming.the 10_year hunt for bin_laden told through the eyes of the cia great storyline and cast it was great to see how they gathered the intel to locate and terminate the most_wanted rag head in the world yo as a obsama supporter this offended me a lot.interesting film managed to keep my full attention the entire 155 min i must say kathryn_bigelow has made some really powerful films but this one topped them all mostly good acting all around.mindblowing action movie while it's gorgeously shot triumphantly acted and overall very well executed kathryn_bigelow's dramatization about the decade_long hunt for osama_bin laden suffers from dire storytelling and an overall feeling of emptiness the story could be an interesting one but the big problem with mark boal's screenplay is that it doesn't give the audience any reason to care about what happens on the screen it doesn't ponder the morality and methods that cia used nor the question of did killing bin_laden have any kind of significant effect in the end the script is just one big exposition bin full of underdeveloped and hollow characters alongside tons of elaborate information that boal can't translate into a gripping drama and after over two and a half hours it is difficult to understand what was the point of it all if it was to merely inform zero_dark thirty could have_been an enlightening documentary which actually would have_been a far more logical decision since boal is a renowned war reporter despite its vacuity the film's major flaws are also its strengths since it is congruous and definitely doesn't prettify even the darkest sides of terrorist hunt jessica_chastain delivers a devastating performance she certainly deserved the oscar more than jennifer lawrence despite the fact that her character is a distant enigma jason_clarke kyle_chandler and mark strong are also fine in their even more hollow supporting roles in the end zero_dark thirty is nowhere near as thought_provoking and tense as it thinks it is it is not a complete waste of time but a massive missed opportunity.another over rated movie that was decent but i still don't understand the high praise.a very under rated ensemble_cast tells the ultimate post_9 11 story that is in some ways hard to watch yet easy to root for.the movie was boring and unnatural i did not like it at all.excellent acting and pacing well worth your time and money the film is devoid of the pro army propaganda that ruins most american war films today this is the thinking mans war film bravo.while recalling real history events it still tries to make a hollywood esque story which doesn't fit well.wittingly surreal and a truly captivating touch on the events leading_up to the bin_laden assassination mission zero_dark thirty captures the true nature of the united_states military prior to their illegalization of waterboarding and other methods of torture brought upon by the torment of terrorism at the turn of the century chastain provides a thick and stature performance in this suspenseful thriller along with a cast to back up her findings on the biggest event post_9 11 another surreal documentary of terrorism and a fine achievement made by academy_award winning director kathryn_bigelow 4.5 stars.it is not a great movie but it worths the time at_least you don't get bored in the middle of it it's also well_done without obvious mistakes.bigelow's attention to detail and chastain's powerhouse performance make the greatest manhunts in history one of the top movies of 2013 this is a brilliant movie most of the news events the plot is built around are stories i have seen of tv news hence making the movie feel more relevant told from the pov of americans the movie touches on the emotions and thoughts of america and takes us through the years america hunted osama without it feeling like it lacks in detail great movie even_though it might not be entirely accurate in the specific events that happened.muddy story telling but a tense and interesting end.sinceramente no fue mi hit de ese a\\xc3\\xb1o otra m\\xc3\\xa1s de este g\\xc3\\xa9nero.dull and predictable.although it isn't my_favorite topic zero_dark thirty is really well made i do have to agree with the r rating though parents due to the violence and intense torchure scenes this movie is definitely not for kids or for the fient of heart there are swears used throughout the movie as well zero_dark thirty tells the true_story about how usama bin lauden was killed it starts with phone calls from that fateful day of september_11 2001 from there the story moves to one of the suspected accomplices as he's tortchured for information by the cia.meanwhile we meet maya played by jessica_chastain despite being told to forget about this case maya decides to continue she knows that several lives are lost including some of her friends and therefore decides to continue.the acting was superb in zero_dark thirty jessica_chastain really commits to her role and in my_opinion gives the performance of a lifetime it's a lot like captain phillips in the sense that you're still on the edge of your_seat even_though you know what the outcome will be.amidst all the violence swearing and troubling scenes this katherine bigalow story has a message about perseverance.i have much to say about this film first it is quite a good movie and well told story overall still it's impossible for my political views not to influence what i think of this movie i can't stand terrorism or the thought that anyone is out there who just wants to randomly hurt strangers merely because they're american hold on though i'm also thoroughly disgusted by anyone who would want the job of torturing i'm not saying that the job isn't necessary but it's so unsavory that only an unsavory person could take up such a thing when i see someone tortured my mind automatically starts hating the ones doing it to them so guess what i'm not the man to be torturing people and i hate even the thought that it is done and people go to great lengths to justify it this movie was worth_watching a couple parts were too much for my sensibilities i found myself without any love or respect whatsoever for the supposed heroes they are 1 dimensional and frightening personalities they are just doing their job what can i say great movie i feel a disgust for humanity when i see it because i hate to imagine the evil on both_sides of a conflict furthermore how horrible that innocent people could get caught into this mess this was well cast and acted i know because they did such a good job that i can't_help but feel immense hatred for people who torture for a living your little propaganda film here probably had the opposite effect you want on this philosopher as is often the case with these gritty real world dramas the film lives and dies solely on how immersive the narrative is zero_dark thirty definitely takes you on a journey and avoids the misstep of making it overly personal but it falls shy of enthralling me.the film tells the long drawn out tale of the hunt for osama_bin laden we are shown distressing scenes of torture evidence gathering and some famous terror attacks that took_place in the interim the narrative moves on at a mostly even pace although there is a certain lack of exposition we the audience are left to figure the stakes and characters out for ourselves while refreshing it can be a bit tedious at times.there was some top_notch acting here jessica_chastain is great in the lead showing a very wide range of emotion jason_clarke was appropriately terrifying during the torture scenes the rest of the supporters did exactly was supporting characters do best provide people for the main characters to bounce off of.certainly an interesting story but not rewatchable.awesome feel good movie bravo for the americans and the unrelenting tenacity of the cia_agent for getting the job done\\xc3\\xa2 but there's still much to do unfortunately good work excellent cinematic representation well deserved oscar this movie is a solid action drama and thriller that has an element of suspense and mystery that will keep you glued to the screen to find out what happens next to the greatest man hunt of cia finding osama_bin laden dramatizing the manhunt for the world's dangerous man wasn't that easy as it has been criticize the by the public politics and alleged controversies that surrounds the real_life story though there are moments in the movie that deems to be boring because of its long sequences of actions i can't_help but notice one of the most notable acting performance by jessica_chastain's role as a cia lead in the manhunt she delivered the role and act effortlessly that earned her a 2012 oscar nomination for best actress chastain superb performance and act bring an ingredient to complete it for a critical acclaim film i hope chastain does future movies with critically acclaimed acting like this one i especially like her last scene shot in the movie where she cried silently as she goes home to us overall satisfying action and thriller war film.a truthful inner look at recent historical tragedy shines a new light on the terror in the middle_east with terrific acting and a well crafted script.a relatively engaging movie about torture intelligence and the hunt for bin_laden at_times the pace was a little too slow and it almost felt like a tv crime drama but overall interesting albeit partly trying to figure out how accurate the movie was the central character was perhaps a bit too big a part of the movie maybe coulda cut down a few minutes and advanced the plot a little more briskly too much politics going on not enough action for me but apart from that it was a pretty good movie.very suspenseful and with a great take on a real_life story but it fails to address the morality in the hunt for terrorism.the movie is slow admittedly but the story works not sure how close the movie was to the real story but the final action scene was absolutely fantastic one of the best action_sequences i have ever_seen what a spectacle.it delivers on the level of giving us a sense of the frustration and minutiae of the 10_year struggle to get osama_bin laden it had my interest but i can't say it was exciting or exhilarating.see what interrogations did yeah they got that asshole just watched this again enjoyed it just as much a truly gripping film with a fascinating story and excellent acting the accuracy of the events in the story has been called into question but as a stand alone film it's very well made highly recommended definitely one of the best films of the year excellent and exciting film i much prefer this one to bigelow's the hurt_locker jessica_chastain is excellent and i think deserving of best actress oscar give this one a try as usual i don't_know but if hollywood filmmakers don't_know the difference between different arab accents or even between urdu and arabic i think this is a disaster however the movies is technically great no i will not see this garbage i absolutely refuse to contribute any money to this jingoistic product of katheryn bigelow's military obsession i won't see it in theaters i won't redbox it i wouldn't even watch it for free on tv or at a friend's house.this was a good movie because i love what it is about but i think it was a little played out about.i don't think it was anything special at all it got so boring and uninteresting that i lost track with the storyline and nothing mattered anymore.\\xc3\\xa9

compelling the hurt_locker zero_dark thirty seems like somewhat of a step down for director kathryn_bigelow while no doubt confidently and carefully directed by bigelow that features an excellent performance from jessica_chastain it just feels like it is missing something.it'd be easy for me to discuss whether it was the right thing to do to kill osama_bin laden or the belief of whether it was an inside job or not as i'm sure for some people that played into the factor of whether or not they liked the film but just strictly talking about the film itself it is crafted very well the film has a lot of content to cover that spans many years and the film does an excellent job of making it all work and fit together and it also has plenty of shocking moments the flow of time is perfect and nothing feels rushed the film has a great pace and for the most part i didn't feel the length of it everything that happens on screen is something that directly affects the plot and it never deviates and just shows us everything important that we need to see however that is also a problem with the film all it shows us are facts and procedurals in a very straightforward way that i think the film would have_been better off as a documentary i enjoy films that treat their audience with respect and intelligence and i like films that aren't just explosions every 5 minutes but like others have said there is a reason everyone praises the final raid so much it's because nothing really happens in the first 2 hours it's just gaining the intel on what to do i was with the film for more than half of it and i was very interested but the more it kept going the more it just lost me it dragged on and i really don't think it needed to be as long as it was considering the final raid went on far too_long even if it did seem kind of odd that all this was set up over a hunch what if he wasn't there the film is very cold and i felt quite distant from everything that happened which is odd considering the subject_matter argo handled it much better and made it a very engaging and exciting watch it doesn't really help when the characters aren't allowed to breathe nor do anything to flesh them out i know i said it had a great pace but that is also something that hurts the film it goes by so fast that the characters are just empty shells to just read what's on the script for a film like this i don't think it's a priority to give deep background to the characters as that isn't really the point of the film but it always helps and it's odd that it has the same screenwriter as the hurt_locker because that film had excellent characters there is one exception to that rule and that is jessica_chastain she is the lead of the film and it is natural for her to have some sort of depth and she does seeing her rise from her dusty cramped desk to the person leading the infiltration is great to see and she does an excellent job even if it was kind of off putting to have her absent for the final raid considering she put it all together and what she said i'm going to kill bin_laden i understand she isn't going to be in the frontline or anything but she should have at_least been in the helicopter or something everyone else does a good job and they all work well with each_other even if they really are not given a lot to work with it also has a few surprises i wondered where joel_edgerton was for a while as from looking at the cast list he as well as christ pratt had top billing especially on imdb and i thought he would have_been in jason clarke's role but they're both in the great gatsby though it certainly was odd to see mark strong with hair though.this film certainly took a lot of risks though given the subject_matter and some of what happens in it mostly at the start the film is damned if it does show it and damned if it doesn't the film certainly has garnered some controversy and understandably so but i do think that the film is very un hollywoodized and it feels quite authentic and even if it is not which is most likely the case i'd like to find a film based_on a true_story that didn't exaggerate anything there was a scene that showed that someone working for the cia was a muslim and i liked that scene because of how it is filmed and because it happens and nobody makes a big deal out of it even_though i'm sure some audience members did neither of these films felt like they were really taking any sides and just told the story as it is but with a subject of a film like this i think that's harder to achieve i think it would have_been interesting if some audio clips from the world trade center film were played during the opening though the film looks absolutely beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing but i would expect nothing less from alexandre desplat.this is a different style of film for bigelow and she proves why she is a brilliant filmmaker this film will annoy and unease some and offend others and it knows that but it does nothing to compromise the story i do wonder though how this film would have originally ended if bin_laden hadn't have_been killed it certainly would have_been odd and felt somewhat incomplete but i don't think anything better could have happened for someone making a film like this and i like how we never actually see his face in the film it is a great film to make after the hurt_locker and seen from a different perspective and it's a great continuation of sorts and we even see someone in a bomb suit and it would have_been cool if there was nod to that film with a close up showing jeremy renner but i'm getting too far off point it might accomplish everything it set out to do but sometimes that isn't enough and like i said at that point it should have just been a documentary the hurt_locker stayed with me after i saw it and i'll never forget it and this film started to lose me before it even ended i don't mean to come across like i'm comparing the two to judge which is better i'm just using it as a reference although i will say seeing both of the scores for both audience and critics be so close for both films is odd to me i know not exactly the same audience so both films but still zero_dark thirty might be a concise and smart way of showing what_happened during the hunt and eventual death of osama_bin laden but it isn't very engaging or all that interesting but it's another film off the list.gripping drama depicting the hunt for osama_bin laden executed tremendously by kathryn_bigelow and lead with a superb performance from jessica chastain.solid it wasn't great nor was it terrible i don't_know how accurate it was but it was interesting eh i'd say maybe watch it if you like historical war type films.an outstanding piece of journalistic filmmaking with a terrific lead performance from jessica_chastain full review later.though it does indeed have many intense sequences for those expecting a high action war film zero_dark thirty doesn't cut the cake however it is still well_acted well executed and overall pretty interesting.enhanced rhetorical techniquesbigelow's great i admire her but i'm still not sure where she stands on the use of torture in the cia and as movie entertainment she never calls it torture she uses the euphemistic acronym eit enhanced interrogation techniques want more how about eqm enriched questioning methods aes augmented enquiry simulations or just call it what it is t a torture and answers when asked if torture effectively led to the whereabouts of bin_laden she is deliberately vague but clearly states that due to a compressed movie plot 0dark30 made it seem like it did in her story the victims of torture appear to be treated better_than i imagined they never gave misleading answers so the torture would stop they never coughed up what the interrogator wanted to hear i got the feeling that the torture was somehow redeeming for them like an intense workout no pain no gain and even_though it was implied that the captives wouldn't be around to identify their inquisitors afterwards they were rewarded with tender words and hummus the glossing over these interrogative ordeals sweetens the message of torture as an indispensable necessity the movie begins with torture and ends with the capture of obl the cause and effect is unmistakable.that the liberal media is jumping all over this is no surprise that the picture has been snubbed at the oscars is also telling bigelow offers us a very well crafted movie that celebrates gwb's overtly hostile america after watching 0d30 and reassessing hurt_locker i'm impressed by the way bigelow manages to document the crazy courageous misfits needed to engage in wartime activity she is a sharp and audacious filmmaker and another gop apologist it wouldn't surprise me to find her at some future republican convention arguing with an empty chair.boring until the last 20_minutes or sozero dark_thirty is a well crafted film about the hunt for osama_bin laden the movie pays fine attention to detail of the search as well as jessica_chastain's character perhaps we could have gotten a more emotional story out of this but as it is this film is a well directed manhunt with a very suspenseful climax.a movie based_on how we smoked theses monsters beautifully done loved every moment very good really well_done all round great mix of genres as the investigation went on.did you like hurt_locker did you like me upon reading the hype and watching the trailer for this reading all the names attached think hey this might be a bit preachy but over all a really well made piece of work did you well if you did i'm really sorry to burst your bubble but this ineffective drivel just kind of drips out for almost 3 fuckin hours i like before have stated that i adore epic films christ one of my_favourite films is tora tora tora and thats round about the 4 hour mark but what sets those films aside from zero_dark thirty is not only the fact that in the entire time it was on i only remembered the name of the protagonist maya i'll get to her performance in a minute the entire story has no characters it has woeful writing it is uninteresting and non thrilling in anyway thought watching soldiers breach osama_bin laden's fortress would be tense you know like how it would have_been for the president kathryn_bigelow the woman that brought us the super tense hurt_locker makes that entire sequence seem like an episode of coronation street bare with me here because there is a lot to talk about here zero_dark thirty revolves around the events between september 11th 2001 and may 1st 2011 basically the time in which it took for a horrendous spree of terror attacks on the world and an atrocious war by our home lands on iraq and afghanistan a plethora of torture and humilation of pow's and eventually the assassination of osama himself we follow specifically the uninteresting story of maya who is assigned to the cia in the middle_east straight from graduation she is introduced to a world of torture and fear attempts on opperatives lives however she is so commited over the time span to catch a messenger boy that she eventually is led to what she believes to be the compound in which osama may be hiding sounds great doesnt it lot's to work with millions of different angles to look at the situation from lots of tension lots of character building maya is not a character she is a paper thin all american stereotype plopped on screen from start to finish and shows about 2 of a character arc throughout i'm not blaming jessica_chastain she just has nothing to work with at all here her dialogue is atrocious when asked by a government official who she is her reply is and i quote i'm the mother fucker who found him have you ever ever in your life heard anyone say that honestly it's alright though because this script writer seems to think that writing swear words every 4 lines makes your film gritty and serious more like it makes you look like a 15 year old writer excited to hear about the rest of the cast mark strong harold perrineu james_gandolfini john barrowman kyle_chandler joel_edgerton jason_clarke and chris_pratt well ladies and gentlemen dont be because between all of the combined the have a total of say 20_minutes screen time maybe 30 at a push you have all these fantastic actors working on what should be a tense story line and instead you have them walking into a room swear and walk out every single actor on that list swears multiple times in the small moments they have to inspire us kyle_chandler puts in the best effort as the head of opperations but for some unexplained reason he just gets flung away half way through well just because john barrowman is in the film for 4 minutes is his inclusion and talent warranted or needed for the role no he is not played to his strengths at all james_gandolfini is ok but your looking at the screen and going oh look theres james_gandolfini because the dialogue is so horrendous by the time it takes him to get on screen youve found a way to filter the words from your head scenes play out like this swearing something shocking conversation cars lots of muslims walking about cia talking torture cars something shocking conversation so on and so forth until the final sequence which is so dark presumably to cover up how bad the cgi helicopters are that you cannot see a dam thing all you see are little lights running about in the dark with the occasional outline of a building luckiliy the compound is bright white which helps in extreme darkness the entire thing looks like its shot off the back of a camera mans shoulder fine does it add anything no some shots a so terrible you cant even work out why they exist in the film ever wanted to see a dirty shot with an out of focus corner of a barrior with the roof of a car drive into a building didnt think you did what else is wrong with this film well zero_dark thirty feels the need to inconsistantly insert screens telling us the name of the chapter why well just in case you got so bored with it you needed to work out what was going on i understand there is a lot of time hopping so i'll let the every 2 minutes being in a different location and having them write a paragraph of where they are but seriously you need a title card to say human error before a scene that lasts 2 minutes where mark strong swears for a minutes and then some girl you dont know shows up with a file out of the blue and goes hey human error no this is not how you make a film christ film is a visual medium if i cannot work out a rough idea of what is going on by just looking at it what hope has anyone else got problems just solve themselves with zero tension involved and finally the films biggest and most vicious flaw who am i suppose to be routing for in this film i'm presuming its the americans however they are shown to be so disgusting that the film actually has you question if a terrorist group are the good guys this film actually makes you feel bad for people who want to kill and strike fear into the hearts of others if thats what it was intended to do then great but eh whats with all the high and mighty american fuck yeah war machine glorification now i am by no way saying that i condone the actions of any terrorist group but this film made me question it mixed in with paper thin characters the good guys really arent ones to route for does it do things right meh occasionally there are springs of something gritty and horrific but its dealt with in such a fuck yeah way that i have no reaction to it i jumped once in this film due to a jump scare the rest of the time i spent just wondering where it all went wrong the script was not focused the actors under utilized the action non thrilling the look ho hum music barely noticed it as i write this review i am already forgetting most of what_happened in it worthless paper thin and totally mixed messaged honestly just avoid the thing.it was ok don't have to see it againa deftly made propaganda film that justifies illegal tortureawesome drama and what better justice tham seem osama being kill but it does't take away of the thrilling feel of this filmkathryn bigelow directs one of the most inescapably suspenseful cinematic trips in american history both she and chasten deserve to be remembered for it still alive family guyzero dark_thirty is one of the most expertly and masterfully crafted films i've_ever seen in a long time intense intriguing suspenseful well directed and strongly acted it's a non_stop craze of the world's greatest manhunt.fogolyk\\xc3\\xadnz\\xc3\\xa1sokkal gitm\\xc3\\xb3val abu ghraib bal neh\\xc3\\xa9z mit kezdeni a simple linear narrative with a pared back performance by jessica_chastain makes for a compelling film that does not gloss over or glorify the dogged pursuit and killing of bin_laden it makes no moral judgments itself but leaves the audience with plenty of food for thought bigelow in both this and the hurt_locker offers interesting insights to the post_9 11 american military mindset.one of the best films i have seenvery slow but the ending is ok fast forward to the end all the stories and this one takes us into the night of iraq's most disguising plan to take saddam.i gave this movie 3.5 stars i thought the movie went into a lot of detail with the cia and what they would do to get information they wanted and needed also showing the bay at the beginning and all the torture i thought was kind of neat to see but all together i thought the movie was little boring and slow maybe some parts just went on longer than they needed to and it got a little boring at_times and would lose me but the people who played the cia agents did a good job and showing how the agents really do it so i thought that it was pretty neat there 3 it was interesting but they investigated for a really long time it just was stretched too_long i did like when they finally found him and when it showed her reaction it was nice too see her emotions and how hard she worked for this.i give this movie a 3 out of 5 because this movie was kind of boring i mean it took a long time before it got to any sort of action and in the beginning of the movie two people were torturing a terrorist and that wasn't really action they were just torturing him and as the movie went on it would just keep on getting more and more boring because all that they did was talk about bin_laden and they were looking for him but first they had to find a guy by the name of ahmad sha and it was just like they were kind of sitting around and just watching to see what he would do next but as it got closer to the end of the movie you could really get a feel of what it was it was like for the soldiers to do what they had to do to kill bin_laden and you could really see how dark it was at night where they were at also i didn't really like how all they would do is talk about bin_laden it didn't seem to me like they were really doing anything but taking pictures of them.it's an interesting dramatic piece that redirects the damage of bin_laden to one cia officer but truthfully it does little else special it's solid but hardly impressive.much better_than i thought it was going to be and true to the actual_events as far as i can tell.jessica chastain is awesome.awesome movie gripping well tolddan bismillah al rahman al rahim then roughly translates allah rewards those that strive and fight over those that sit behind a desk.dark edgy tense disturbing must watch is how i would describe it in one word though must watch ain't one word the movie is based_on the 10_year manhunt for osama_bin laden by the us cia after the tragic 9_11 attack that finally came to an end after operation neptune spear the movie revolves around a lone wolf cia_agent maya who sticks to her conviction that bin_laden is not in a cave in afghanistan hunched over a kidney dialysis machine but is likely living in relatively open sight and how the maya faction makes the maya non believers to believe in her conviction based_on her own field research because had she been wrong mr.barack obama would had been quite embarrassed and in deep trouble trying to explain why he invaded his own ally country pakistan with his team of seals without the pak govt's consent eventually the whole world did saw on 2nd may 2011 that maya and the us govt was indeed correct y the depiction of events might not be 100 correct but they are kind of relatable indeed been a while since i've_seen this so the only things i remember are those that bothered me from the film and also others opinions about it as well so these are my opinions on both lead female character has almost a creepy obsession with bin_laden so much that it seems like she'd go full on necrophilia for him torture despite what most people seem to say could have_been more brutal cruel etc so it really wasn't as shocking as it could have_been sneaking in someone's house in another country and killing them in the night while they're sleeping in the name of patriotism justice or whatever your excuse is just plain weird creepy and wrong no matter who it is lastly i can't_help but feel people are uprating this moving because it's yeah go murica kill people who've wronged us propaganda but i guess you'll have that dude do you even realize what you just did zero_dark thirty is quite the remarkable movie in any number of ways it's highly controversial but grounds itself in an almost frighteningly real authenticity that must be seen to be believed the film's ability to captivate its audience and maintain a steady rhythm even with an extended runtime and a foreknowledge of even some of the secondary story items is truly remarkable bigelow's craftsmanship is so good it seems almost beyond the limits of the medium she captures an essence an authenticity an attention to detail a grittiness a reality that's incredibly difficult to achieve in film and she does so by telling a story everybody knows but few really know and even fewer truly understand the film is a technical masterpiece and very well performed to boot it oozes a realism that's rare in cinema and with that realism comes understandably difficult themes that have generated controversy but that are absolutely necessary to the contextual foundation of the story and critical in recreating as authentic a history as possible this is a brilliant film in every regard that no matter one's stance on the many arguments around it is well worth the price of admission and then some.decided to wait for the bloated nationalism to calm down before i viewed this one and then it just slipped between the cracks finally just watched it overall i would say a decent but very over rated movie about a subject_matter that was always going to gain more attention that the merits of the movie itself deserved that it won academy_award for sound is fair enough but nominated for best picture and best female actor you are kidding me the plot was solid enough but there was something very hollow about it all dan going home because they killed his monkeys wondered why we spent 15 seconds seeing them eating his ice cream and there was no substance behind why jessica became so obsessed the attempt to link it to her female colleague being killed was far too late and far too weak having lunch together at the marriott and surviving the bombing spare me the contrived link she went from being a determined inexperienced agent trying to do her job to a manic obsessive compulsive without one shred of real reason behind why and when they finally agreed to go for it she then oversaw the entire operation even forming a relationshiup with seal_team members wtf there comes a point in some movies that it is time to let the lead role go clearly the focus should have then switched to the seal_team members having her hovering around like a nanny watching over them and even witnessing the body was a contrived construct designed to keep the lead in front of the camera there was far too much obvious constructs and far too little substance throughout the film reasonable direction and solid acting but yet another war movie that was nothing to write home about.this detailed and dramatized outlook of the hunt for osama_bin laden is easily one of the best films of 2012 bigelow is the queen of tension this movie runs in at an impressive 2hr 37 min but at no point do you lose interest it's a thrilling tale from the outset and despite how you feel politically about the events within as a movie it holds strong excellent stuff 2015 03 17 brutal at start hard to watch very dark probably realistic.capture scene was completely without tension and the movie was about an hour longer than need be jennifer ehle's death was predictable and insulting to women overall argo was better or at_least a lot more fun.maybe a piece too_long but gritty honest and a true_story love jessica_chastain especially her reactions at the end in the plane.zero dark_thirty isn't a bad movie and does well to present its facts and creative liberties with no seen agendas behind them which i give major props to however it's simply a forgettable film a little too simplistic for its own good other than a few specific scenes and the ending military operation nothing here stands out or is worth seeing unless you're very interested in the subject_matter and even then reading a book or researching would probably have the same if not an even better effect.excellent watchable filmi sincerely expected to think this was a good movie but it felt like pure propaganda we know you felt really uncomfortable with all the torture in the first hour but see it worked we had to do that yuck.it's close to 3 hours in length but races by kathyn bigelow's thriller is absolutely entralling i loved it i loved it i loved it.i understand when filmmakers want to make their movies realistic in fact i prefer that most of the time however this movie almost felt like a documentary and not in a good way there was no emotion no interesting dialogue no twist i did overall find the movie interesting well_acted and pretty intense at_times but it's ultimately the most uncontroversial movie about the most potentially controversial subject.the movie was so good.all the action has me really interested and i could not take my eyes off of it although i did not like how the movie wasn't really how it actually occured zero_dark thirty was surprisingly wonderful this movie shows realism that people need showing the world its never safe always follow in what you believe in not in what people tell you.not what i had expected was hoping for some more action scene acting was okay i thought redda kateb did a job well done.zero dark_thirty is a good movie that highlights the conflict between characters and conflict but i would rate this rated r due to high use of profanity and nudity.zero dark_thirty the decade_long hunt everyon remembers the most devastating event tha probably couldve occurred in the united_states in mean who could forget the day that people lost their_lives because of an insensitive act upon a terriosts 9_11 was truly a tramatic event for the united_states 9_11 has so much meaning the day things esculated so quickly with no first notice zero_dark thirty turns the decade lond hunt for osama_bin laden the mastermind behind 9_11 terriost attacks on the world trade center.the film stars jessica_chastain as maya a fictional cia intelligence analyst dan played by jason_clarke joseph bradley as kyle chandle and reda kateb as amma the lond search lasting from day to night month to month from then on years to years their reassigned to the u.s embassy in pakistan to go on the manhunt for osama_bin laden honestly i must say zero_dark thirty was a brillant movie in so many differnet ways jason clarke's roll is herrific his acting puts you on the edge of your seats his confidence just puts the icing on the cake also his demanding voice will have you wanting to tell the truth hand claps to jessica chaistain played as maya her constant curiosty and demanding personality was terrific her strong desrie to want to be on the case had me in suspense the whole time overall every step of the way was fulfulling there was never a time throughout the movie i was clueless which i am often the movie did not leave out much information the took us a long the way i honestly despies movies that leaves me in awe i will not like it because i will not get it and i probably would never watch that movie again although this movie just left me in suspense with a lot of curiousty.every heard of the phrases everything catches upm to you what goes around comes around do not ever think your past will not xcatch up to you because it will you can run but you can't hide all of those sayings in my personal opinion fits the moralof this movie.this movie was very interesting and suspenseful zero_dark thirty is people on the hunt for osama_bin laden you should watch this movie if you are into historic fiction moviesnot really my thingy.i do think this is an excellent movie it's just slowmuch is to be complained about the accuracy of this and any other film based_on true events people or places but this is a movie made solely for entertainment purposes there isn't a based_on a true_story film to date that won't dissatisfy you if you read the true_story immediately following the film that being said this is a fine work of film from bigelow delivered by an academy_award worthy performance from chastain whom deserved it more than lawrence the films build and suspense make quite the journey to follow about a true american hero murica 87 wow what a powerful piece of cinema while there was certainly slow scenes this three hour movie held my interest until the very last shot the slow burn of buildup in the first 2 hours leads to a masterfully crafted final act that left be breathless at the end this movie is truly an experience that should be seen by everyone at_least once 9.25 10way too_long hang in there good dramatic movie.a high voltage realistic and gritty thriller that portrays the real world as scary and terrifying.want more action but gave us a great story.slow burn sleek documentary drama with outstanding performances and high tension sequences.a little slow on the pacing but pretty incredible perseverance i liked the raw picture of the barbaric but possibly necessary interrogation tactics needed in the ugly thing called war.it's pretty good but kind of a disappointment if you compare it to bigelow's previous film the hurt_locker problematic it's as if paul greengrass had directed top gun a serious subject topped and tailed with nail biting sequences but fatally let down by some bizarre casting decisions and the curse of modern hollywood mumblespeak.a bit long but a solid movie jessica_chastain is as good as always.zero dark_thirty is an exhilaratingly brutal look at the desperation of the u.s government to capture more specifically kill osama_bin laden during the post_9 11 era it's exceedingly human but deceptively cruel and manages to brilliantly balance those tones throughout the film leaning to impressive action set_pieces brutal torture sequences and somber intimate moments.this is one of the film's greatest assets as well as a clever script from director kathryn_bigelow and star performances from all involved jessica_chastain is once_again grippingly cold and jason_clarke is surprisingly emotional other standouts include jennifer_ehle kyle_chandler and chris_pratt these performances help elevate the film above the standard of the genre.two of the film's most riveting scenes involve those with jennifer_ehle the first is where her and chastain are out for dinner and the cafe explodes presumably referencing the bali bombings the other includes ehle's character trying to persuade an al quida doctor to come into the military base this ultimately does not end well.some of the film's most confronting moments come during the final moments those when chastain's character is questioned about whether she truly believes bin_laden is hiding in a civilian home this leads to a military attack on the him when upon return chastain's maya opens a body bag to reveal the face of bin_laden these final scenes show how desperate how obsessed the american government had become during the greatest_manhunt in recent memory.it shows that bigelow is respectful of the subject but that she does not shy away from the harsher aspects of the story rather she embraces them to create a fully real dangerous world in spite of some mediocre tedious political drama something that ultimately the film had to address zero_dark thirty is beautifully made.awesome action spot on with historical truths and accuracy's.makes me feel american graphic depiction of the hunt for bin larden clever storytelling and just brilliant filmmaking overall this is right up there with the hurt_locker and a solid companion piece it's not shock that the same director guided both filmsserious well_acted moviegreat film real showing how hard people worked to find the most_wanted man in the world great film and brilliant performance from the women actress worth seeing \\xd1\\x82\\xd0\\xbd \\xd1\\x8f suspenseful and exciting a rather soppy ending.overly long and boring until the last 1 4this is a must watch the only thing is if you are expecting a documentary on seal_team six then you are going to the wrong movie.this film is a successful thriller be warned though the depictions of the violent interrogation methods used by intelligence officers are confronting.i wish we were keeping what are seals were doing a little more secret instead of showing their capabilities to the enemy the mvie was good and i watched it because i am proud of our military.one of the most important moments in recent history even if you know the ending you don't_know the story how much of this is actual truth where the government is concerned who knows either way these_men who hunted that bearded fuck down are heroes this may not show us everything we want or need to know but it sure as hell ain't a propaganda flick but it is one hell of a thriller despite every one watching knowing the ending.well made and good performancesa must_see for the historic content a good movie just not great.with another terrific performance by jessica_chastain zero_dark thirty proves to be a suspenseful and well crafted true_story detailing the hunt for osama_bin laden the question is not why was she spared the question is why were so many others not spared extremely boring and long movie not much substance.kathryn bigelow has done it again this movie was a masterpiece it is about the 10_year hunt for osama_bin laden and it is so well_acted great action and a great adaption for one of the worst person ever jessica chanstain was amazing in her role myia and it had great just everything almost needed night_vision goggles to watch this gives a valuable perspective on the need to have goals after our goals are met.on one hand zero_dark thirty is a chance to show the world the mission of taking down one of histories most notorious terrorists on the other it's a chance for jessica_chastain kathryn_bigelow to show the world what they can do both angles manage heart stopping compelling results.story telling the long hard journey to take down oblintense awesome and a beautifully shot film.the writers and the director of this made what should have_been a decent movie into a lifetime movie with guns i don't_know what true event they based a majority of the movie on the only thing they seemed to get right was the beginning and end of the movie overall this is just another b movie piece of crap in the same class as the hurt locker.dark enough raid scene might as well just close your eyes.i had high hopes for this film because i love stories based_on true events but was thoroughly disappointed about half way in i realised i was bored to tears and even the ending with the killing of osama_bin laden couldn't make me excited about itsome 19 guys with box cutters being directed by a guy who lived in a cave brought all of our rights patriot act other executive orders to take a away civil liberties put a camera on every street corner of every single major city in america new police formed and fema camps erected feel safe from the terrorists we call government yet the biggest fraud feed to the people look up spare change and black flag operations this whole drama with this capturing osama the same man our president hung out with and fed money to this joke still continues with this terrible subject with drama to make us look like heroes in this movie america is not what it once was fantastic movie dark suspenseful gritty the only time i was bummed to be one of only two people in the movie theater this movie does not encourage heavy petting unless you are a very special kind of person and i am not that kind of person.for some reason my original review of this film was erased so now i have to remind myself of this horrible film again doing some research about the film prior to viewing it i discovered that the new york times was championing ms bigelow to get an oscar remind me to never read the new york times again.as i watched this film a sadistic tale in which the concept of justice seems to have_been paper shredded and thrown out with the paper shredder a feeling of isolation began to overwhelm me not unlike the feeling the object of the main protagonists must have felt and maybe like that guy i felt like i couldn't move even_though i wanted to stop watching the film as much as possible.at the end of the film i felt like i had just been water boarded.it's strange how america has descended to probably its greatest low in its very short history.zero dark_thirty was one of the most gripping films i have ever_seen jessica_chastain was phenomenal perfect lots of action.zero dark_thirty is an incredible film it is about the decade_long hunt for al_qaeda terrorist leader osama_bin laden jessica_chastain and chris_pratt give excellent performances the script is well written kathryn_bigelow did a great job directing this movie i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the drama zero_dark thirty is a must see.the cia and military brass fed torture glorifying propaganda to kathryn_bigelow about the hunt for bin_laden who then made a movie about it.for a decade an elite team of intelligence and military operatives working in secret across the globe devoted themselves to a single goal to find and eliminate osama_bin laden this is the story of history's greatest_manhunt for the world's most_dangerous man.one of my_favourite films of all time this film outlines a female american government's agent's goal to find and eridicate the wold of osama_bin laden brilliantly acted by jessica_chastain and supporting_cast it shows the grit and determination of hers to find bin_laden and carry out the raid on his hideoutin abbotabad.a very well crafted and tense film kathryn_bigelow once_again shows her impressive skill as an action thriller director even if some of the profound importance gets lost in the overabundance of unnecessary scenes and detail.irritating character behavior with nothing more intelligent to say than the f wordput all the political stuff aside for a minute whether you feel the war in iraq and the hunt for bin_laden was right to do or humane or whatever it makes no difference to me when i am watching a movie so you are not going to find some long political commentary here zero_dark thirty takes a subject that almost everyone_knows the story of and everyone_knows how it ultimately ends and still they were able to make a good movie out of it i guess i can start out by saying jessica_chastain was really good in this movie she won an oscar for her role but honestly i think you could have taken any pretty good actress and put her in this role and it would still be a good movie i don't think she made zero_dark thirty better_than it already was nor did she make it worse as we see in this movie the hunt for the worlds most_wanted man was an long and sometimes brutal journey jason_clarke is the standout acting wise in this movie for me some of the interrogation scenes are so realistic that its actually hard to watch but i however do not think they went overboard in their portrayal in the interrogation of prisoners but in the end even_though you know what is coming you are still on the edge of your_seat at seal_team six enters the compound where they believe the terrorist is hiding it is truly suspenseful filmmaking brilliant i might even say and you still get a satisfaction when you see the outcome.put all the political stuff

outcome.this film makes me have a greater respect for the intelligence community and the individuals responsible for bringing down the biggest asshole since hitler but this film seems to take a serious amount of time to build_up the action.this dramatized hunt for bin_laden is detailed and well_acted but to me it felt more like a documentary than a film it was too impersonal with it's characters and it didn't develop the villain bin_laden almost at all maya the woman this movie is centered upon does give an interesting performance as she transforms from a gentle and frightened agent into a bloodthirsty hunter but you still feel like you don't_know her by the end the movie spends too much time hunting bin_laden and too little time making its characters seem human instead of mindless robots questioning detainees and searching through paper's for an enemy we don't even get to know in the movie.riveting this film is a mustsee it's simply the best drama thriller film in years as much as i loved jennifer lawrence's performance in silver linings playbook she had nothing on jessica_chastain who should've rightfully won at the oscars 45 saw this on 05 08 2013this film has the worst cinematography ever given to a mainstream cinema and it's ending is an eyesore and katheryn bigelow should see sicario to know how night_vision can be really used in a film that too without shaking the fucking camera the story is mostly boring but the acting is fine and the film maintains some tension especially in the torture scenes in the first half.spolier alert they kill osama_bin ladenfour hours would still not be even enough if you want to put everything in it now it seems get stuck in the middle.thoroughly enjoyed it but would have liked to see more of the heart racing frantically shot sequences that made thl a winner the final half_hour or so is a triumph in cinematographydirector kathryn_bigelow once_again successfully caught the critics attention with another movie about middle_east and this time about the hunting of most_wanted criminal osama_bin laden as same as the first movie who successfully raised jeremy renner's popularity jessica_chastain got the attention for playing a strong willed woman to caught the most_wanted criminal on earth golden globe and some other awards are the mark of her success for playing the character maya an awful ahistorical tom clancy ish piece of torture porn.very good in every way.if it's politically or socially acceptable yet to say so this movie was overhyped at_times it gets really slow and the little subplots introduced to distract us are bland.compacting an array of events over 12 years down to 160 minutes takes some sharp editing story cutting but it's done quite effectively there is a fair bit of jargon an expectant responsibility by the viewer to just know a lot about pivotal plot points such as terror attack times places political instabilities misinformation tensions wikileaks etc but to fit it all in under 2 hrs still allow for thar final acr of storming the compound is done with great finesse even if it does skip through it all quickly at_times it was after all one of the usa's infamous cat no bald eagle mouse affairs you gotta give em credit for finally gettin their villan what a high risk feat it was.neither condemning nor condoning kathryn_bigelow captures again the real vulnerable and emotional elements with compassion while i could do without torture scenes it would have_been a whole lot less real of a movie without it and this was a whole lot more of a movie than argo chastain is oscar worthy in her performance.i wasn't a huge fan of the hurt_locker i remember thinking it was cliched nonsense that had been hugely overrated this is a much better and grown up film albeit not startingly original for vast swathes of it's running_time it's basically homeland the movie talking of that running_time it's pretty chunky and i was surprised how quickly the film passes which goes to prove i was intrigued i liked it certainly worth the 3 hours of your time even if at_times just like homeland it's very unbelievable.tedious and drawn out but it picks up at the end with some high profile actors and good suspense.a sufferance to watch chickflicka pretty damn good film chronicling the 11 year man hunt for osama_bin laden i was going to go a half star lower because something was a little off for me but jessica_chastain was absolutely fantastic as the cia_agent heading the search for osama_bin laden.she was tough precise and worked extremely hard at her craft as her performance was very believable.i loved how the movie built and built but i feel due to the long time frame it's impossible to include all the things you should the movie skipped a lot of years which really had to be done to fit in the movie.i am not a big fan of these types of films but the acting was pretty damn good here and it really carried the movie it felt like a real operation i was watching and there were good moments i thought it would be a little bit more intense however it did have its moments a solid film on a tense subject built on the foundation of solid acting.when you know how a movie is going to end it better be damn good.this despite its flaws was damn good.an emotional roller coaster ride originally written on may 1 2014 zero_dark thirty is a damn fine film it very much deserves all of the accolades that it has been praised for jessica_chastain in particular gives an incredibly powerful performance as maya the lead cia investigator charged with the impossible finding osama_bin laden the criminal mastermind behind 9_11 and many other cowardly terrorist_attacks against the u.s and bringing him to justice for almost ten years maya searches for a needle in an incredibly frustrating haystack with little to no success but when she finally makes a major discovery that turns out to be the game changer she's been searching for a change in the administration may take it all away an incredible film understandably a film documenting several years will pace slowly this film is a prime example that even films that are shoved further into the realm of complete realism don't necessarily make an amazing movie.llena de suspenso tecnicamente impecable y una increible actuacion de jessica_chastain llevan a este filme con tematica poco interesante y repetitiva a una experiencia muy disfrutable el ritmo es extremo disparejo pero se compensa.fascinating in many ways horrid and depressing as well but nevertheless interesting with a tough lady in the lead.i loved this movie my first kathryn_bigelow movie i haven't_seen the hurt_locker but have heard how great it is and i do have point break but i haven't watched it yet the last_30 minutes alone are well worth the price of admission everything leading_up to it i'll say it's up to you to decide zero_dark thirty is directed by kathryn_bigelow and it stars jessica_chastain jason_clarke kyle_chandler and mark strong in a thriller film about the search for bin_laden in many years until it finally lead to his defeat when director kathryn_bigelow and writer mark_boal created this film i remember being excited for the first time and loved it when i first saw it even if it wasn't what i expected of it since i reviewed the hurt_locker which was better_than i remembered it i figured that i should watch this again to see if the opinion is the same or if it's very overrated but since you already saw the score that i got you already_know what i thought of it this was the first film that i've_seen of jessica_chastain and she was fantastic in it and so is jason_clarke whom i also never seen until now the plot is really good and it takes advantage of its long running_time with great dialogue from mark boal's script the characters are good even_though i would've like to know more about the characters as i barely know anything about them besides of their optimism to get osama_bin laden there are a lot of well known cast members in here and they all give a great performance here the movie does a good job of portraying how tired and irritating it is that they can't find the guy until many years later when they found them when it gets to the last 20_minutes of it the movie gets really tense it's smart of what the soldiers have to do and the action is realistically tense to watch even_though zero_dark thirty has more problems that i come up with than the hurt_locker i enjoyed it just as much as that and i would love to see another film from the same director and same writer.great movie very tense in the last_30 minutes exceptional acting performance from jessica chastain.watchable not brilliant.another great film by bigelow and jessica_chastain vaults herself into the top tier of actresses the final_30 minutes is some of the most suspenseful stuff around but the leadup to the climax can be difficult to follow.jessica chastain was robbed she deserved the oscar way more than jennifer lawrence.while a brilliant film in terms of the technical aspects it could have benefited from a faster narrative for the first and second acts the final conclusion comes down like a surging wave of electrical film making energy and tension jessica chasten is also remarkable here.welcome to the propaganda of the 21st century if only they didn't state that this is based_on a true_story it would honestly be an easy 4 stars movie if anybody believes this non sense then they have actually succeeded in the brainwashing our brains be smart and don't believe what the government tries to feed you with.zero dark_thirty is directed by kathryn_bigelow and stars jessica_chastain jason_clarke kyle_chandler and chris_pratt the film goes into detailed scenarios about the hunt for terrorist killer osama_bin laden zero_dark thirty is a very well made film the majority of the film is in detailed long scenes mostly of dialogue that can stray most audiences away from the film but with bigelow's intelligent story telling and pristine way of direction she gives the film more wanted tension and steers it into a well told drama jessica_chastain gives a career breaking performance her clear devotion to the subject leaves a powerful strong performance left on screen impacting the movie for the greater good the films finale is fantastic even_though most of us know the outcome the final_30 minutes drips suspension the pov action_sequences are intensely done that will send chills down your spine zero_dark thirty is an immensely done drama that adds a great thrilling aspect bigelows remarkable story telling and use of the camera results in zero_dark thirty becoming one of best films of the year.better than expected.lets be honest here there have_been many people that state that zero_dark thirty was totally fake however though the film may or may not be 100 realistic zero_dark thirty is still an excellent film the film revolves around the events after 9_11 and the struggles it took to hunt osama_bin laden kathryn_bigelow is a great director and with zero_dark thirty she crafts he best film yet i feel bigelow has found what types of movies she's best at which are her war movies and for those of you who don't_know she made the hurt_locker 2009 and that was another great film zero_dark thirty also has a terrific cast personally in my_opinion i felt jessica_chastain's performance as maya was the best performance in this dil i felt chastain totally stole the show which is amazing do to the fact that the movies she was in prior to this one were films such as the help 2011 and the tree of life 2011 however though i loved zero_dark thirty i thought argo 2012 was a much better political thriller but thats just me also if you want an action film this is not a film for you but if you want to see an excellent political drama and are fine with little to no action than i recommend zero_dark thirty for you.lead character is a badass woman what's not to love zero_dark thirty uses drama to tell the story of the terrorism that has been happening to americans for the last 10 years the plot to zero_dark thirty is that a woman named maya who works for the government and the military has experienced the biggest terrorist_attacks on america for the since 1998 to 2011 during her work for the government she has devoted her time to finding the psychotic man known as osama_bin laden and bringing down the his followers known as al_qaeda the movie starts off with voices yelling on one of the flights of the september_11 attacks this is a dark way to allow the audience to know what the movie is about throughout the movie it shows maya's character change as she goes from a shy and awkward girl to a strong and independent woman there are some scenes in the movie that just are boring and make the movie drag on the movie's climax is somewhat entertaining it's filmed in the dark while occasionally showing the perspective of a soldier wearing night_vision goggles jessica_chastain gives the audience a great performance as maya along with chris_pratt he give a splendid performance as well alexandry desplat exceeds in composing sad and dramatic music which fits in perfectly for every scene it is in one of zero_dark thirty's biggest problems is the camera work pretty much every scene in the movie the cameraman is holding the camera for some scenes it can be found tolerable but others it's just annoying and overused if you are a person who enjoys historic dramas then i highly_recommend you watch zero_dark thirty as it has splendid acting an amazing plot and great music although the movie isn't perfect it has some issues these being a not very entertaining climax some boring scenes and the handheld camera being used too often i give 2012 s zero_dark thirty a 7.5 10 procedural interesting but ultimately pretty dry outside of the final_30 minutes its arguably a little slow.a realistic and intense cinematic experience a must watch film portrays the cia's false narrative regarding how they tracked down bin_laden the protagonists are disgusting fucks who torture prisoners making it extremely difficult to root for them even when they are trying to track down a mass murderer.zero dark_thirty 2012 1 2 d kathryn_bigelow jessica_chastain joel_edgerton chris_pratt jason_clarke reda kateb kyle_chandler extremely suspenseful film details search for osama_bin laden told with intimate feeling and those tremendous claustrophobic touches bigelow also used in the hurt_locker the characters are all interesting and believable taut visceral excitement hampered by an anti climax and some mundane dialogue oscar winner for sound editing.thrilling behind the scenes capture of osama_bin laden.a wonderful film that tells the rising and capture of bin_laden great performances script and very suspenseful and compelling after hurt_locker bigelow directs another amazing film the film does bog down a little bit towards the middle but it's just a minor gripe in an otherwise great film.after saving_private ryan this movie comes close in the modern daywhile a bit slow at_times it makes up for it's powerful visual storytelling and compelling ending with a lot of detail and enough suspense it's a sheer nonfictional drama with at_least three well known actors and a fairly dark theme while most of the details didn't capture much of my attention it still felt quite realistic and the locations of filming were spot on.bit of a pacing problem with this movie couldn't keep my attention also not a good tension and release ratiothe only thing that put me off from watching this was the running_time but eventually i got round to watching it even_though i expected a boring documentary type film but it was about one of the most important days in recent history so i knew i would take something good away from watching it it was very gripping from start to finish it takes us through all the major events post_9 11 it was very well told it can be hard to keep up due to the fact that there was so many weird names being brought up but when the main focus of the film kicks in it was brilliant very well shot and acted by all the cast very realistic and deserved all the praise it was given.it's not your regular action film and it take a lot of contextual knowledge for one to fully understand the movie the plot doesn't really flow smoothly if it weren't for the base story line the killing of osama_bin laden i would've walked out of the cinema mid movie i'm also not a fan of the camera work the lighting was unbalanced especially during the most intense scenes the house raid that being said the acting was superb and i have to applaud jessica_chastain for perfectly conveying the emotions of her character.is a film to see when you don t have anything to do in your sundays afternoondark grim clinical dense expert engrossing gruelling you're forced to participate in the decade_long manhunt with an almost unbearably tense payoff like david fincher's zodiac it puts the cost of obsession not only in terms of time but in terms of humanity.combine homeland with the patty duke show and this is what you get bad acting complete fiction for a supposed historical drama and terrible film making.a movie which is beautifully cast and well_acted despite being based_on a true_story this film still manages to find a way to keep the viewer on the edge of their seats.everyone has been told this is based_on the true events leading_up to the capture and of the hunt for osama_bin laden a little slow at_times as others have stated but stay with it and it's worth the watch on a personal note if that's all they really are doing to terrorists they best be glad someone like maya is there doing the terrorizing and i'm not in charge bc that's not enough imo people commenting are saying they're upset with the torture that's shown in this movie so it's ok i guess that their form of torture is beheading and filming the act and sending it to the entire world among other things the people who were trained by osama are still terrorizing the entire world after he's long been dead and all their punishment is they have to be naked in front of a woman they feel like but aren't actually drowned oh suck it up buttercup and cry me a river water_boarding would be the least of their worries they are the worst of the worst kind of prisoners and never were americans they despise us so how can people say that we're violating their civil rights when they don't have civil rights to begin with based_on just those 2 things alone prisoners have no civil rights imo you commit a crime you give up your civil rights that is if we still had these prisoners but now thanks to our fearless muslim leader he's given them all back for a traitor american who imo should never be allowed in this country again are there any left he hasn't set free for some reason or another this movie needs a sequel to tell what's happened as a result of the capture and killing of osama not just how his capture happened it's not the usual type of movies i watch as i'm not into war movies but i enjoyed this film alot have seen it several times since it has come out and have never been more proud of our military who rooted him out of his hole yes it may have taken 10yrs i fully believe that pakistan knew he was there so i don't trust them and think we should nuke all the countries al quaeda still exists we sent a bomb to hiroshima and haven't had a problem out of japan since have we so nuke iran iraq pakistan afghanistan and all the countries in between flatten them to nothing for everything they've done to not only america but the rest of the world and we won't have a problem with them anymore either it would make for a great sequel to this movie problem solved.it's about the hunt for osama_bin laden the terrorist organization leader of the september_11 terrorist_attacks on the united_states and the night we killed the world most_wanted terrorist in history by united_states navy_seals seal_team 6un loooong build_up menant \\xc3\\xa0 une finale prenante 2h de drame d'espionnage 30_minutes de combat tactique dans le noir un film bien ficel\\xc3\\xa9.an excellent war movie of them versus us the ethics question is asked but never answered directly.intense thrilling and very realistic zero_dark thirty is an amazing movie with some brilliant acting.brilliant film enjoyed it the first time on dvd about a year ago and just watched again today on blu ray and found it even more amazing gets you gripped right from the start i found the camp chapman attack scene very moving the only thing that stopped me giving this 5_stars was the final assault on bin_laden's hide out i found this very slow moving when a mission of this sort would have_been extremely fast_paced and full of adrenaline certainly no time for conversations but that was the only downfall in my eyes and i understand that as its a film it was probably slowed down to make the scene longer but like i say this then makes it abit unrealistic brilliant job 9 10 will watch for a 3rd time in the future no doubt.a well paced suspenseful dramatization.some of the dialogue may be a bit repetitious but bigelow's direction is very effective and she knows how to maintain a constant level of nerve racking tension in this descriptive and essentially objective account of a historical operation whose end is already known.zero dark_thirty is the story of how the us military eventually found and killed usama bin_laden i really enjoyed the film despite the massive amount of information the movie throws at you which could risk bogging down and boring audiences you really have to lock yourself into the first thirty minutes or so of this one or it might become too easy to become distracted but if one can successfully do that i believe that they will have an excellent time with this film the camerawork is very well_done and the acting is very believable and convincing especially from jessica_chastain my only issue with the film besides the potential to become boring for some is that the characters were not well realized although well_acted but while watching it didn't matter to me that much but it would've_been nice to see what was going on in these people's lives more.i trust zero_dark thirty must be a hit with al_qaeda isis.i guess they miss the part where osama_bin laden meets the 72 virgins.otherwise a somewhat boring and very predictable film the high scores here on rotten tomatoes are beyond my comprehensionawesome movie about time we got him perfectly paced edge of your_seat thriller jessica_chastain stands out in an ensemble_cast to show she's a true star.zero dark_thirty seems emotionally detached from its source can't convey the message it wants even chastain's performance can't make it worth the watch.it's frustratingly difficult but that comes with the territory of what this film explores but it all becomes worth it for the scene at the end.self righteous and a bit psychopathic film about the motivations to kill make a point killing revenge killing army killing don't say the englishes don't_know how to find a target and do a proper assassination after this we better not mention anything about iraq film very mechanical this murder that plosion more murders the story is very cinematic but leave off so much hail the englishes the best invader ever with the freedom to kill at will wherever you are self righteous and a bit psychopathic film about the motivations to kill make a point killing revenge killing army killing don't say the englishes don't_know how to find a target and do a proper assassination after this we better not mention anything about iraq film very mechanical this murder that plosion more murders the story is very cinematic but leave off so much hail the englishes the best invader ever with the freedom to kill at will wherever you are this was good didn't live up to the hype imo.well i liked it up until the end and it didnt really come together looking back on it i felt it was horribly directed at_least 3 times i had to question whether or not i had drifted or day dreamed through a scene because all of a sudden the story would be advanced much further than we were just minutes sometimes even seconds before with no explanation of how we arrived there considering how long this movies was and how slow it was at_times i feel like things could have easily have_been rearranged to clear some things up also the way the final scene was shot was really hard to watch by that i mean i couldnt actually watch it because i couldnt see what the heck was going on i get they were going for an authentic look like the lights were off in the real story so lets turn all the lights off in the film thats great for like a cut or two but it felt like a good 30_minutes of not being able to see anything at all then to make matters worse they would tease us with the night_vision view of a seals perspective which to me should have_been flipped it should have_been 90 night_vision 10 darkness not the other way around i would say i maybe would have given the movie a 3 star review up to that point but then i went to the internet to research more on the matter and found out all of these inaccuracies and stretches of the truth and i can officially say i didnt care for the movie poor accurate portrayal poor directing poor editing poor choice of cinematography poor movie a brilliant film that shows perspectives interwoven with true events it's less about facts and more about human beings and what happens to them in circumstances beyond their control especially those that they're trying to control.this is a masterpiece of naturalism and a work of mad genius by a stupendously talented filmmaker and a revolutionary ms kathryn bigelow.seems like one of the most anticipated and best movie of 2012 is one of the movies that i didnt enjoy for me although there was alot going on action and fantastic acting there just didnt seem to moving and i felt bored throughout the movie majorly disappointed may watch again with lower expectations grade byou can't deny the filmmaking talent it took to make zero_dark thirty and the movie certainly lives up to expectations when it comes to being intense especially in the final_30 minutes whilst the movie can feel a bit slow at_times due to the investigative nature of the first two thirds it's never boring and benefits from an impressive performance by jessica_chastain in short the movie lived up to if not exceeded my expectations.while it is technically a very well made film and chastain's strong performance is the driving force it is also unnecessarily long over simplified not very entertaining devoid of any true emotion chaotically filmed and i fear that it's also not an entirely truthful depiction of events.no inmolation no virgins for you in heaven ossama i guess that ak was for decoration we will never know the truth so this story looks better_than official versions and is really well made since it is not a documentary 4 5 intense thrilling and disturbing.well made but how much of this is horseshit is worthy of debate.another serious oversight by the academy this deserved best picture and acting honors for chastain.absolutely loved this moviehistorical accuracy aside kathryn_bigelow is a first class director and zero_dark thirty is a first class film jessica_chastain also shines in the leading role fleshing out all the inner complexities of maya's personality this film is poignant and thoroughly insightful.interesting to hardcore political nuts zero_dark thirty chronicles the hunt for osama_bin laden with jessica_chastain along the wayas much as i wanted to like it more there's not a great deal that can be heavily dramatised with this sort of material it was worth making a film about this subject i guess but equally a documentary would've_been just as welcome it didnt come across pro torture or against it so in that regard wasnt a propaganda piece unless like me you dont believe the guy is even dead and is instead swanning it somewhere living in a 5 star beach cabin paid for unknowingly by the american tax payer the thing in itself though stands up well enough due to the meandering score and the atmosphere kathryn_bigelow is so good at creating as well as jessica_chastain's decent enough acting however it's no hurt_locker which really was a great film.good depressing dark movie about the most tragic event in the past decade 9_11 starring jessica_chastain chris_pratt the guy from dawn of the planet of the apes and joel_edgerton or something like that i don't want to say i was entertained but i will say it's very educational and would a good movie to see at school for educational purposes only going into this movie i didn't know what to expect and what i thought this movie was about is aliens but no it proved me wrong jessica_chastain is phenomenal in this but she didn't feel like a proper main_character she felt more like a supporting character because no one in this movie is the main_character to me does this movie deserve the oscar nominations yeah because their were no other good movies that year so that's why it was given the oscar nominations.my full opinion 8.1 10 the hunt for bin_laden was stressful and the film conveys that excellently jessica_chastain is fantastic the story is engaging and the finale is suspenseful.i prefer her previous film but still amazing.heran juga sama pembuatan film ini gua mikir cepet juga ya pembuatan filmnya hanya setahun but keren jalan pelemnya inijust get to the raid just get to the raid just get to the raid the end.zero dark_thirty is a incredible film it is one of the most intense films i have ever_seen kathryn_bigelow did a fantastic job on creating tensions and making the story as true as it could be the acting was fantastic especially from jessica_chastain who goes through all kinds of emotional ranges in this the last 40 minuets is some of the best movie making i have ever_seen i was on the edge of my_seat with my hands sweating i was so nervous i felt like i was with seal_team 6 in the raid and forgot i was watching a movie my only flaw with this film is that it is a little long but in the movies defense they had to fit 10 years of events into this film this is a movie you are going to definitely want to see great job kathryn_bigelow good spy movie about the new war on terror and how it's fought excellent lead actress jessica_chastain bigelow hasn't made a movie i enjoyed since 1991 s point break but this one is good too.que film\\xc3\\xa3o da porra 5 11 17 an overacted movie that goes for an hour too long.puntaje original 6.5con una trama difusa y muy decepcionante zero_dark thirty no cuenta

g\\xc3\\xa9nero a pesar de tener momento visualmente impactantes.this film was not what i expected slow ponderous and intelligent very well made some will be disappointing if they were expecting an action thriller.but for a film that grabs your attention and makes you this this is a winner.nice movie i always wondered what_happened behind the scenes chastain was awesome as the main_character cia_agent she's awesome interesting from an historical viewpoint but overall this film was not to my liking perhaps because i am not american and couldn't really connect to it on a personal level aan ggn afi dkathryn bigelow does it for me again she manages to make the best movies i have seen however following up to the hurt_locker she re teams up with screenwriter and producing partner mark_boal and they have made practically the most intense war film i have seen like the hurt_locker zero_dark thirty is one of those few movies where it isn't all guns ablazing testosterone filled action it's smart it manages to stay focused on the subject even if we get certain side moments fueled by an intense yet fragile jessica_chastain this is one of the few movies where your eyes are practically glued to the screen this is a way of saying i couldn't bring myself to take my eyes off the movie while it was playing zero_dark thirty has easily made it into my top favorites list.kinda like gandalf zero_dark thirtybetween all the factual accuracy and controversies and unfortunate events the film fails to bind all of these into one entertaining drama resulting into an exhausting experience of 156 minutes of just plain old news zero_dark thirty is of course written explicitly and executed with conviction but there is not a single lose thread for the audience to hang on to it until the curtain drops jessica_chastain holds on to her part of the role tightly till the end and is convincing throughout being aware of the pressure she has on this project since she is the only glue that binds it all and if they'd have given that character more gravitas and depth along with some high pitched dramatic sequences it would have just worked zero_dark thirty is the slow pill that takes its time offering weird sensations and some pain along the long road and then results into being the same old pain killer.an astounding and suspenseful film that tells us that following the 9_11 terrorist_attacks osama_bin laden becomes one of the most_wanted men on the planet and the worldwide manhunt for the terrorist leader occupies the resources and attention of usa a dedicated cia female operative jessica_chastain proves instrumental in finally locating bin_laden in order to take action and finally kill him it has a good structure and it is so gripping and then satisfying nominated for best picture best actress best screenplay best editing and winner of best sound editing i guess argo was really hard to beat.it's awesome in it's camera techniques and jessica_chastain gives a wonderful performance but this film left me feeling as uncertain as the protagonist.jessica was robbed of oscar best actress jennifer lawrence slept with harvey to win shamezero dark_thirty is a brilliant and suspenseful true_story about the years of searching and the eventual finding of osama_bin laden the film is well directed by kathryn_bigelow and well written by mark_boal which both come to make the great true_story film it is the film gives an excellent lead performance by jessica_chastain playing the secret agent fbi agent maya who we still don't_know much about till this day the story of all the terrorism and investigation everyone had been waiting for since 9_11 is something a lot of people including myself would consider a good film if jessica_chastain could learn to act this would've_been a very good movie alas it's solid but nothing great though the facts of the story are pretty interesting if they are facts this film is the personification of all style and no substance it jumps around with no solidly developed characters to hold on to for guidance throughout which just made this film a frustrating jumbled mess it was interesting to look at but nothing else i'm afraid to say with it not really get interesting till the actual raid scenes overall i would describe the film as having zero storyline with dark cinematography at_times with a running_time that is thirty minutes longer than it needed to be.controversial and riveting it's one of best films of the year miles better_than the moderate argo due to the strong female lead substantive plot gritty location and broader scope bloody and brilliant.i just don't see anything good in the movie it wasn't factual maya was an fictional character the plot was not too exciting music was non existent.this is a perfect movie one which should have earned director kathryn_bigelow a second oscar for best director it is a truly powerful film that will have you on the edge of your_seat even_though you already_know the ending a fantastic achievement.i rarely give 5stars but this brilliantly crafted movie deserves it yea yea great movie coming from a sof background i'm aware of some of the facts can't vouch for all of the personal interactions the basic story line is accurate down to and including the real participants the main attack charging on horseback has become a special_forces legend all involved deserve the utmost credit for the bravery audiences that like action films will not be disappointed.besides a few laughs here and there and also maybe 5 10 minutes of an okay action sequence this movie is boring and is all over the place with its pacing a highly inaccurate depiction of military action and i would just wait till it's on netflix.always interested in true stories better_than hollywood's version.more american propaganda yah one strong is just thor doing a shoot up 12_strong the declassified true_story of the horse_soldiers review 2018 the good chris_hemsworth is good you care about his character who basically wants to avenge the lives on 9 11michael shannon is always greatmichael pena is goodtrevante rhodes is goodnavid negahban is great as general\\xc3\\xa2 abdul rashid dostum \\xc3\\xa2 the leader of the alliance and is now vice president of afghanistanrob riggle is good in this nicolai_fuglsig decent direction in his directorial debutthe writing is pretty good since its based off true events from a book taylor sheridan is in this which is cool the bad if you like buildup and some development that's good but if you want action you have to wait nearly a hour into the film for it and the film is nearly 2 hours longthe cgi is terrible on some partsthe pacing is not great on some pointswilliam fichtner has like the same generic emotion he has for like yearssome of the other characters could of had a little more development and more development with the main 3 families overall it's a decent enjoyable war film that definitely is making this january way better_than last years january overall grade bentertaining and fairly accurate account of the mission acting was excellent the terrain they filmed on was very similar to the real thing.this was such a beautiful movie willing to see it again i give this more than 5 looking forward to this and i never listen to the critics they are 90 wrong on every movie i trust them on.perfect timing for good old fashioned flag waver chris_hemsworth is thor captain america and john wayne all rolled into one one of my_favorite actors michael shannon's star also shines rated r for war violence dont really trust movie critics to rally behind movies about heroism in war hemsworth is an affable star that seems to keep his mouth shut on politics so i will probably go see this one.pretty much the only movie where we finally get to see the aftermath of the infamous attacks done in september 2001 actually based_on a true_story called horse_soldiers which is completely non fictional by the way and i hate to say that because in my sense nowadays i see it as a common clich\\xc3\\xa9 with hardly any twists put to it 12_strong remains strong but eventually fails to come up with plan b just in case plan a flops which most likely here it does somewhere around the middle of the film for history purposes i see it as a very great film for other purposes however i see it as a disappointment to keep up with moviegoers alike.good movie enjoyable interactions between the team members as well as some glimpses into the over arching forces history and feelings of the time.this was a truly beautiful story with great acting this is the type of movie i would go out and buy and i do not buy movies.an insult to good propagandists12 strong which should have remained entitled horse_soldiers is the green berets of the war on terror starring chris_hemsworth as john wayne competently made if uninspired it's still a movie than the aforementioned the green berets unfortunately that's not saying much.if the critics hate it this bad then i know i will love it.incredible movie must_see in the theater so thankful for men who did whatever it took to have our first victory in afghanistan after 9_11 for that i say thankful to the 12 strog and all the support troops.it felt like the movie went nowhere12 strong was a fantastic depiction of real events that not even those of us who were paying attention knew about at the time this is the kind of movie hollywood should have_been making for the last 15 years as our best and our brightest have not been at harvard or yale they've been kicking up dust and guarding their brother's backs in wars fought on the other side of the world rotten tomatoes claims the movie lacked nuance what they meant was that this movie didn't portray soldiers as broken victims with no other choices or portray america as some expansionist empire bent on domination it simply portrayed what was great movie.extremely interesting a must_see saw it opening friday 1.19.18ps critics use of phrase lacks nuance is code for lacks any sympathy for terrorists make you proud to be an american great movie i am giving 12_strong 5_stars because vern michaels is my brother a good movie with out the sjws and feminist man bashing.incredible story very well written excellent acting and the cinematography is stellar for those looking for action war movies the entire second_half of this movie is pure action 12_strong is a must_see movie that honors america's finest and gives you a front row seat to america's first counter attack against an evil terrorist regime in the heart of afghanistan there is no sugar coating of ideals and motives for instance you will see the most strict forms of islam in full display in this movie.if you are a veteran who's been in the middle_east or know anybody who has this movie will hit home and you'll leave feeling incredibly proud of those who serve our_country as well as the hero afghanis who fight alongside with us.i haven't forgotten 911 a good reminder of the unsung heroes.acting great but writing and editing is horriblei really enjoyed this movie all americans should see this movie to appreciate the sacrifices of the men it depicts great performances by the cast and i appreciated the attention to military details.great action scenes acting was abominable the script could have_been written by a child 12_strong wasn't a bad movie but it was more or less underwhelming chris_hemsworth thor the avengers films and oscar nominee michael_shannon revolutionary road nocturnal animals star in 12_strong a powerful new war drama from alcon entertainment black label media and jerry bruckheimer films based_on the book best selling book horse_soldiers it is story of heroism based_on true events that unfolded a world away in the aftermath of 9_11 for some reason war films are the key pieces of art that really get to me i don't have any family members in the war right now but it's something about the realism grittiness and emotional reality that often comes with them 12_strong is something i've been looking forward to ever since the trailers dropped but after watching this film it was underwhelming now that's not to say that it was terrible or that it did anything really wrong but it never really amounted to much.while a well known cast headlines this story i don't think anyone really gets to shine nor does anyone stand out i think chris_hemsworth is a solid albeit mediocre lead he's supported by guys like michael pena michael_shannon and navid_negahban but no one really gives there best performance here granted i wouldn't say they were given the world to work with but i think the performances were just decent at best i guess the problem was the character_development wasn't strong enough so whenever i saw these_guys on screen i didn't see them as the soldiers they were portraying rather as chris_hemsworth michael_shannon etc i do like that this film focuses on the relationship_between these soldiers and this unknown ally it brings up the very true fact that not all of afghanistan is bad there are many groups and organizations who fight against the taliban there's a rope thin relationship_between the americans and the residing population which really shows a lot about the situation i am glad they were able to show the brave and enduring people who reside in afghanistan and fight these wars it's something that lone_survivor touched on and i get to see more of that in this film if anything this movie is just underwhelming it's something that can be entertaining and it can be meaningful but it never goes the extra mile i'm sitting there waiting for something more to happen i'm waiting for more characterization i'm waiting for more emotion hell i'm even waiting for more action they just never really knew what part of this story to focus on and that left me wanting more i was left with a half completed story that felt like it was missing something like i said i don't think this movie is bad it just didn't do anything that stood out to me.in the end 12_strong is an okay war film there are certainly better ones than this but while this one had good intentions it never really gave us a reason to invest more into it 12_strong is well_acted intense war drama and a thrilling fact based story that honors the people involved even if it abandons emotional depth and strong character_development in favor of overblown war sequences as a 50 married female i loved it and learned from it as well to all the heroes thank you.the brilliance of this movie matches the brilliance of our leaders the us intelligence people and our military people who planned and carried out this campaign top rate acting script and scenery.important story that is very well told.great movie left me on the edge of my_seat hard to believe this is based_on a true story.good but stupid when 100 terrorists are walking toward you supposedly surrendering but carrying 100 ak 47s you tell them to drop their weapons you don't just let the army walk up to you armed there is no way this is what actually happened the rest of the movie is ok.the story of the horse_soldiers of afghanistan in the wake of the september 11th attack is pretty damn remarkable as told in 12_strong 12 american soldiers became the first american soldiers to hit back at al_qaeda by riding horses over some of the roughest terrain on the planet and taking the fight to the enemy in a way that hadn't been seen since roosevelt and the rough riders https serve.media movie review 12_strong _ga 2.171603872.1417020870.1515348633 953607229.1513947710what a great movie must seeinteresting story unknown story told wellwar movies are tough to make perfect there's politics involved unfortunately with most reviews and even when liberals try to make their review non political you can still tell anyway if you're a patriot militarily or former you'll love this movie it's a shame that nazi liberals just don't want this movie to be a block buster on the other hand i do.almost perfect great characters great action with a few story hick ups but none the less jerry b delivered.a story about american soldiers starring an australian lead and director from norway they couldn't find an american actor to play an american soldier seriously forget some of the mixed elitist critical reviews this is an amazing true_story of heroism and honor too bad we had to wait so long for this story to be told 12_strong with chris hensworth in the lead role and a story that honors its story and real_life facts 12_strong is the perfect way to honor american hero's whose courage and determination have not gone unoticed while being a cinemaitc success at the same time.a good action movie but the true_story is so much better_than the movie dialogue is clumsy and preachy at parts action scenes are exciting but do not seem realistic the horse_soldiers deserve a better movie.except for bolshevik putin blurb a patriotic film for america.great to see a non liberal movie about the military in other words the truth about our real american hero's.this is a movie with a real story real acting and a real message extraordinarily well crafted gripping from start to finish don't be persuaded by any review that is less than a strong affirmative vote go see it i loved this movie i highly_recommend it to all it shows the us army at its best the movie also brings back the emotions form 9_11 in vivid detail the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go it has a great deal of special_effects which puts you into the battle at the end of the movie you will want to stand up and cheer this movie reminds us all why we stand at the pledge of allegiance.after a slow start an engaging and interesting story with good performances all around.it's a good movie overall it's a b one of those feel good true life movies where everyone that goes to war comes home safe and happy just in time for christmas throw a shrimp on the barbie and throw this dvd in of 12_strong and enjoy yourself a day of happy endings 12_strong is definitely a good name for the movie it was definitely not 12 weak in fact there was nothing weak about the movie the 12 brave soldiers kicked butt from special_effects explosions to the setting of the tone of the film with the soundtrack it really delivered an experience of heroism i can understand why there is a monument made for these soldiers that stands at the bottom of the world trade center to let terrorists know that a man truly can kick a lot of ass and return home on his horse victorious chris_hemsworth did an excellent job 12_strong is first and foremost a war movie i won't bore you with more details of the synopsis it can be found pretty much anywhere i really liked this movie it was in the same vein of black_hawk down but not quite as dramatic and the writing wasn't quite as moving 12_strong was still a good movie the action scenes felt more real than most war movies_i've seen the violence of course was not gratuitous or for shock value but rather more for emotional connection the loss of life it has its moments of being a 5 star film only to fall short for lack of character_development and connection to the men fighting the battles there are laughs and there are moments you want to cry i was very moved at the end if you want to feel patriotic i strongly suggest you see this film and then continue to support our troops who fight the battles we never see so we can continue to live here with an amazing amount of freedom.small spoiler in the next paragraph:one of the most poignant and horrific scenes involved the main villain a leader for the taliban he interrogated young girls proving they had been educated he then promptly murdered the woman responsible for educating them i assume it was their mother i am very thankful i live in a country where all people have an opportunity to improve their_lives with education to sum up the film was good it just needed a little better writing and a little better character connection and i would have given it 5 stars.excellent movie those men are heroes great performance by chris_hemsworth movie not that good plain basic movie don't seenot a bad film but not so good either my very first 2018 film is very run of the mill as they say solid performances but very average gun play and a story that felt like it should've been more somehow.it's always amazing to me when i see another non fiction war story that i was previously unaware of it makes me wonder how many incredible stories we never hear about because there wasn't a book or a screenplay 12_strong about the 12 soldiers first to enter afghanistan after 9_11 is yet another impressive true tale even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of it's real_life counterparts.the most gratifying aspect to 12_strong is the interesting bond and relationship_between chris hemsworth's captain nelson and navid negahban's general dostum the two have such different viewpoints on the conflict in afghanistan and without much context a few weeks after 9_11 the moral dilemmas the two face are clearly the staple of the film even with a mediocre script and direction there's enough back and forth between the two to keep my attention.in terms of the actual war aspect to 12_strong it's a less than subpar affair in a day when battles may certainly be more difficult to differentiate between sides it seems 12_strong accidentally played into that while the dialogue indicates clearly to me who is in the right the shootouts in the desert and mountains are sporadically shot and chaotically structured it really makes it difficult to tell what is happening where and who is getting shot or bombed perhaps that's exactly what the director intended because it could be closer to how the war actually is but it doesn't play as well on film.overall small character moments are what makes 12_strong worth it but it ultimately is a forgettable war film with a real_life story that is better_than what was put to screen 6.1 10great movie better_than anything that came out over the holidays i could see this one again 3.5 5 12_strong is a solid war movie it s nothing we haven't_seen before but it's enjoyable michael_shannon is underused and most of the the supporting_cast is underdeveloped chris_hemsworth does a fine job and the finale is well_done better_than expected for a january movie.seriously one of the worst war movies i have seen in awhile the people that are rating this great or good movie are blind and ridiculously idiotic the whole movie is so far fetched and feels like a old a team sitcom adventure they had to have watched this after they made it and said to themselves this is bad there is no way anyone of them actually think this is a good movie director included final thought is what_happened here i am sure the less educated merica will love this piece of trump bs fantastic movie much less gory than i expected and little to no foul language that i noticed kept_me hooked from beginning till the end and i loved watching the actual news coverage of september_11 2001 i may have_been young 9 but i still remember every vivid detail the only thing i would change about this movie is how it portrayed the actual attacks i wish they had showed the absolutely harrowing chill that everyone felt young and old the day the towers fell other than that minor detail this movie is phenomenal.great flick and a story we all need to know and never forget awesome what a wonderful tribute to these_men and our military a must_see movie.i saw 12_strong this weekend and loved it critics are giving it 54 this is just more proof the critics have no clue what the hell they are talking about we get it critics it's not cool to like anything that is pro american we get it you are only cool if you like awful depressing movies most people would never want to spend money on and actually go see at the movies this proves you are much smarter and evolved than those of us in the unwashed masses that no think so good please do everyone a favor and quit your job you are obviously no lovers of movies and find it impossible to evaluate something objectively when there is a big split between the audience score and the critics score like there is for this movie the audience score is always right we really enjoyed seeing this movie great action very good special_effects without being gratuitous or self indulgent nice to see a movie that is void of politics and social justice preaching for a change perhaps most refreshing an honest portrayal of the cruelty of the taliban and the bravery of the green berets highly_recommend outstanding movie the critics on here are idiots when you start seeing a 15 20 disparity between the critics and the real people you realize just how biased and out of touch many of them are their comments are alt reality.a horribly paced boring generic war film about a bunch of guys you don't care about doing what something that was apparently really important but was shot to look an amateur playing call of duty while the film did have some lengthy action_sequences the camera never stood still or focused on anything so it was like watching a rube goldburg machine of a war set someone built pressing go and watching chaos unfold this is one of those movies about a group of people who did a heroic act and tries to tell their story only the movie tells no story at all its just a buncha dudes running around in the desert yelling at each_other ouph.a cavalry charge is always good for army recruiting.you're better off rewatching full metal jacket.just watched this film and thought it was great nice to see so insightgreat to watch nice to see green beret based movie.beautiful cinematography strong acting from the full cast good tension for the war scenes i love michael penagreat story good talent somewhat tedious 12_strong is a fairly nuanced and pretty fascinating story of the early stage of the us intervention in afghanistan after 9_11 chris_hemsworth and michael_shannon are both good especually the always great shannon as the leaders of a small group of special_forces soldiers tasked with helping a northern alliance faction defeat the taliban and take over the town of of mazar e sharif.the story is interesting the characters portrayed well but the most crucial flaw of the movie to me is that the battle scenes were dull and poorly directed for a war movie that's a big drawback worth seeing but could have_been much better.watch this especially if you have any trouble discriminating evil other than the movie's powerful message some scenes were unbelievable that is for the good guys.so disappointed expected to see a biopic pseudo documentary about a defining moment in our history instead i saw a captain america transformers marvel comics wanna be director producers totally screwed this up casting was pathetic michael pena as a special ops soldier on horseback the actor with the bald head in charge of the operation ouch rob riggle as some hard ass commander please what a shame what a waste of a great book and a great story thanks to all the men and women who have served our_country during this time your story deserves to be told much better i.e zero_dark thirty hurt_locker et.great movie would recommend itthis movie was amazing mostly because of the director's ability to make you feel like you were there in afghanistan just weeks after the two planes hit the twin towers man he really captured the essence of this battle none of knew much about the horses were emphasized in such a beautiful way i had to look up the director when i got home there was one shot where hemsworth stands up after being shut down and his horse then stands up quickly as hems starts shooting again best shot of the movie kudos to the real horse_soldiers and kudos to this motion picture director for bringing this four weeks in history to our theaters if you were able to appreciate this movie you're truly an idiot.excuse me i thought the war in afghanistan was to massacre the muslims and to bar the rest from the free world 12_strong is a decent war film which despite its faults remains an entertaining experience due to its appealing cast and battle sequences.watch it it's a good well_done movie sometimes you do not have time to soul search when a when a ta task needs to be completed.all out soldiers movie with balanced humor and valor moments of intense thrill and reliefs great movie worth the watch.great movie i was expecting an avg movie and it blew me away great acting and incredibly full of actual intellectual dialog really enjoyed this movie did not know the story it's based_on now i'm going to go pick up the book 12_strong is a great retelling of an incredible story the movie is the portrayal of something seemingly impossible that a group of 12 men and their afghan allies complete together.while this cannot be called chris hemsworth's best performance the cast surrounding him does a good job making their characters friendships and bonds feel legitimate since the movie doesn't hard steer towards the inspirational it may have disappointed some critics but the movie is worth a watch the movie is here to tell you an important story about the bravery perseverance and survival against all odds of a group of twelve men and the afghanistan northern alliance militia it's an unbelievable story and for war movie fans a great watch.just doin the rest of the world a favourwhat most people don't_know is that when the taliban fell just around 100 us soldiers were on the ground this group was 12 of those men the movie did have some bruckheimer embellishments but overall a great story told pretty well with good mix of insights and action these_guys are truly the closest thing we have to real superheroes and the audience gets a pretty good feel for the challenge that the green berets have in being both soldiers and diplomats.lot of people don't_know that it took less than 100 special_forces soldiers to topple the taliban government this is the amazing story of the first battle and first unit to fight the taliban after 9_11 oda 595 lots of action fast_paced chris_hemsworth did a great job portraying the attitude of an a team leader and his relationship with his team as did michael shannon's portrayal of a team sgt i enjoyed the scene in the first part of the movie where the team sgt tells col bowers that cpt mitch nelson mark nutsch in real_life is not the type to allow his career get in the way of a good fight it also captured the spirit of a special_forces team there could have_been more character_development with the other members of the team and what their jobs were it kind of leaves you with the impression that the a teams whole job was to call in air strikes when that was only one of the tools they had to deploy some lessons from tears of the sun would have_been useful the movie touches on it but i would have liked to have seen more on the relationship_between the special_forces soldiers and the members of the northern alliance and their following an afghan plan to combat the taliban lessons that should have_been developed and not forgotten overall this is a movie well worth_watching i enjoyed it.it could have_been much better if it was not done to hollywood style show upgreat movie i read some of the reviews after watching the movie and they are just politically motivated the movie does not get into politics but tells a story of 12 soldiers remember this did actually happen they did what was asked of them action_packed with no dead or slow spots it tells their story for 22 days you dont need to understand the larger story or dig deeper into their mind for this to be a good movie 12_strong is a story well told with solid performances from a fantastic cast however there really isn't much more to it than that there weren't much depth or character_development the emotional aspect of the war was never really examined 12_strong managed to keep the audience engaged for the entirety of the movie and did a great job telling a story that truly needs to be told but maybe it would have benefitted from spending more time delving into the heroes that lived the story.good story as with all of these based_on true events movies i'm sure there are plenty of artistic liberties taken even with that it is amazing that these 12 guys went into a situation like this and came out the other end.i dont know what all the negativity is about from movie critics.this was an amazing action_packed edge of your_seat film telling the true_story about a group of heroic soldiers that basically signed up for a suicide mission in response to 9_11 but what do i know i'm just an average joe who watches movies to be entertained and sometimes inspired moved.i really enjoyed this film and i left out of that theater with great pride appreciation for our us troops that sacrifice experience so much in battle much of which we'll never hear of and even less see in film or books i consider this film to be one of the best military films i've_ever seen i didnt say the best but its up there with the best of the best.a great story told well critics need to get a clue don't like true stories about real_life heroes probably the same critics that loved the world of make believes disney princess star wars.really liked this movie hemsworth fits his role well no fuss no mess just good pacing wow two good movies in a row with jumanji what a treat.i loved it so intense great movie chris_hemsworth delivered a strong performance story line keeps you glued to your_seat revealing a bold brave and dedicated effort by special ops team.i'm fond of historical dramas and war movies i admire men of courage who do give their_lives for their country so selflessly intense gritty cliffhanging and engrossing from the start.and i won't back down no i won't back down.i would follow chris_hemsworth anywhere fortunately he stars in this straight forward depiction of the classified first response to 9_11 unlike films that glorify war and ramp up the battle scenes this one plays more like a documentary which results in a more emotional connection to the characters.very interesting story a must_see grateful to the brave_men whom i'm sure scared the turban off bin_laden early on and detoured more attacks my husband i thought it was good and definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of movie we really need more true_story movies like this of our military truly brave_men who love their country enough to possibly lose their_lives for freedom to those in other countries.a must_see film for everyone based_on real events.absolutely loved it thrilling action bravery story.this movie has hardly any character_development or drama this feels more like a propaganda film rather than a true_story made into a drama the action scenes are quite redeeming but the characters are quite one dimensional.awesome war story with characters you care about and a story everyone can rally behindgreat movie i didn't know the story as a horse person i wish they would have spent more time exploring how these_guys were able to ride these horses with almost no exprerience through unbelievable terrain and in battle i can't imagine how you could do that most inexperienced riders would be overwhelmed just being on a horse that many days unbelievable story see it just to learn the story.there is no emotion or the naunce that a war movie need to have.interesting action_packed many times you will say to yourself oh come on during some of the fighting scenes as usual these_guys have unlimited ammo the fighting on horseback with thor killing so many taliban while never reloading at a full gallop was one of those times i thought oh come on that was just one of many times i was very impressed that the kill ratio was incredibly high at_times i think the taliban actors didnt get the script correct with many getting shot by the same bullet lucky for thor he had the ar 15 with unlimited ammo still you should go see it.sounds like finally there is a good movie about the sandboxgreat story amazing very well_done now i can see why the statue in tribute to them for post 911 movie did a pretty job portraying what this guys actually did.decent film about an interesting topic pretty amazed at the end result but i don't think we had enough time with the characters to really care.great movie much better_than the idiot critic_reviews fantastic battle scenes and camaraderie with the cast one thing though pc correctness apparently has even affected this true_story all the 12 real_life soldiers were white but of course they have to toss in a black guy in the movie to bow to the usual bs and of course they had to make him the sympathetic soldier who cares for and spreads good will.though not a character driven movie the film does a fair job honoring the bravery of these men.it is a fun movie to watch with a great story the cast is also fantastic i did not find myself being drawn into the characters and found it hard to be emotionally invested in the characters because of the lack of depth it is an enjoyable movie but did not blow me away.meh predictable and boring dialogue good enough action scenes but ultimately a disappointment this is no black_hawk down.the casts are so great and so natural it is full with emotions heart touching scenes it is strong just like its name 12_strong hemsworth is fantastic and one of the best military action movies i have ever seenfantastic movie this was one of the best movies_i've seen this year the story line was good with good character_development it was a bit difficult keeping track of who the good guys were i appreciated the fact that the dead bodies were not shown in gory detail and because it was a movie they were necessary i rally enjoyed this moviei thought that it was a great military movie lots of action and even some humor without any sermonizing and patronizing.mostly terrible ride a bit have a battle ride a bit have another battle and continue this for two hours felt nothing that involved me like most of the other recent and somewhat true war flicks.week character_development unrealistic strategic planning depictions a general glossing over of operations and relatively poor special_effects too bad it was an awesome story in real_life and the acting was even good.very funny movie with great facts kept_me at the edge of my_seat the whole timemy gosh this was a great movie seeing how these_men fought tokeep us free was amazing i lived through that fight in my theater seat just wanted to stand up andscream look out duck run then cheer it is worth seeing again youjust have to leave feeling so proudto be an american 12_strong based_on a true_story is a good movie with good performances from hemsworth and navid_negahban the action scenes are also very well directed however this movie suffers from pacing issues and lacks stakes also michael_shannon is very underused and gets very little character_development that being said 12_strong is an entertaining watch.a typical american war film with typical american heroics characters military tactics heavy handed morals winning against overwhelming odds and over the top explosions and combat scenes the action scenes are well put together and the setting is used well but the story is too fragmented and the relationship_between the american captain and the afghan warlord could have_been developed more overall the film is too hollywood in its presentation to have any impact or credibility even_though it is based_on true events.really enjoyed this movie.great movie amazing to see people and events you know portraid my hollywood.excellent war movie believable characters with reasonable development capture the tensions of american families and military honest about the deep ruptures violence and humanity of afghanistan people and tribes hearting rending scene of taliban leader's murder of a mother because she's taught her daughters to read and do math shocking interesting theme of how distrusted strangers become trusted comrades and warriors.an excellent movie rings true the audience score is higher than the review score which in my_opinion generally indicates an ideological bias on the part of some reviewers the audience sees through this in the reviews and is attending anyways saw the movie with male friends and will go to see it again while in theaters and will purchase the dvd when released.chris hemsworth has proven with a variety of comedic roles that he can successfully transition out of his work as thor into other genres and stories the catch is that he needs a good enough script to give him something to work with to differentiate himself from the beefcake image we associate with thor 12_strong doesn't live up to the challenge it's based_on a true_story following the tragic events of 9_11 hemsworth plays captain mitch nelson who has just moved to kentucky with his family he's barely settled into his new place before he's called for service in the wake of the attacks on the world trade center he's a hot head type of guy who has to fight his way back into work and be taken seriously in a leadership position other soldiers played by michael_shannon the shape of water trevante_rhodes moonlight and michael pe\\xc3\\xb1a ant man are off at a training session when they learn of the tragic events all four of them are part of a team of twelve led by nelson who make the decision to leave their present day lives behind for the call of duty despite the mixed opinions from their wives and families.nelson promises that his team known as task force dagger can take on this raid of the taliban within a seemingly impossible three week time period despite the risk and danger presented once they land on their uzbekistan base they form a partnership with a local alliance in general abdul rashid dostum negahban an afghan warlord who also has his own vendetta against the taliban nelson and dostum and their teams travel via horseback through the mountainous area to taliban territory oftentimes struggling with their communication barriers and their very different approaches to combat 12_strong has the subtitle of the declassified true_story of the horse_soldiers which makes me wonder why this mission was classified to begin with and what_happened along the way did people die along the way was it an aborted mission what other tragedy struck this band of twelve soldiers we've seen quite a few post_9 11 war movies now to the point where i'm looking to find what makes each one different why tell this story now i put myself in this uneasy funk expecting something to happen to answer these questions that formed the problem comes with the notion that the movie itself should be keeping me engaged and answering these questions for me it was a tell tale sign from the beginning exposition that the overall execution was going to be a bit generic it races too fast to get the soldiers into combat where then it sits for a majority of its runtime of 130 minutes it becomes repetitious in the middle waiting and watching the various battles at hand between our soldiers and members of the taliban.the filmmakers forgot that the audience needs the before and after as well which is just as important as the combat scenes we get introduced to the wives and girlfriends but no introductory scene lasts long enough to invest in these characters as family men before 9_11 the script by oscar winner ted tally the silence of the lambs and peter craig the town rarely develops any specificity in building these characters setting them apart from each_other i never felt that bond with any of them to feel the tension and danger present of what they are risking michael_shannon and trevante_rhodes are the only two that manage to bring a bit of originality to their characters shannon adds that little wink to his character as if to say hey i'm trying as a nod to us that have_been following his career the other members of the team have familiar faces but i never felt that bond as a brotherhood working together for a better cause i go back to my initial intrigue of why this was classified to begin with what came next after the end credits start rolling director nicolai_fuglsig is relatively new which may explain a lack of build in this story i know that i'm supposed to like this movie due to the courageous efforts put forth by captain nelson and the horse_soldiers i can't_help but feel the film's generic qualities come through all too often beginning with the film's title i feel like there is more to this story as is probably written by journalist doug stanton in his book horse_soldiers which serves as the basis for the film chris_hemsworth is believable in this type of role but doesn't bring anything extra to make captain nelson stand out i'm not sure if the film's ultimate goal is to bring this story to the forefront for the first time or to share something deeper the underlying message asks us how we can come together for the common good when you don't speak the same language both literally and figuratively that is found at the crux of the partnership of nelson and dostum but is never quite explored with any sort of resolution or understanding the story of the horse_soldiers deserves to be told but 12_strong doesn't quite know how to make it impactful given its importance in our fight against the taliban.is it worth your trip to the movies you can pass on this generic combat movierating 2 out of 5 ticket stubsgreat film entertaining inspiring 12_strong is a movie that entertains and also makes the viewer stronger for we learn about true hero's that should inspire us all individuals who risk life as well as limb and never receive the fame fortune or glory for literally the battles they fight for all us 12_strong tells the incredible true_story about twelve of america's bravest who were sent in right after 911 to insure that justice would be sought after this hideous attack on our homeland 12_strong is not the greatest movie but it's message comes through loud and clear about true heroism and for that reason everyone who appreciates freedom should make the decision to see it.great story captivating loved it i thought it was an intense movie the acting was exceptional put things in perspective i would watch this again for sure.really solid film had me on the hedge of my_seat a few times.great straight forward war film about the adventures of the horse_soldiers with countless movies about the tragedy that left america in shock and anger 12_strong follows a different story than most with the first attacking line against osama_bin laden the a list cast consisting of chris_hemsworth michael_shannon and michael pena along with others add a good and familiar face to this gritty war drama everyone giving good performances across the board even the minor characters and generic soldiers shown throughout the movie as well the overall story is clear cut and set up within the first 20_minutes and holds strongly throughout with some cliches scattered throughout the film that could be clouded over since it is based off of true events some of the scenes did feel discriminating with its depictions of americans and the towns and locations throughout shockingly there weren't that many action war as shown in the trailers and promotions for the film but the biggest battle is definitely the most intense with it's feeling of threat and danger most for our cast but the big battle did have continuity errors throughout with recycled shots of headshots missile firing and people coming in and out of cover shooting overall the movie did well with it's first time director and seeing hemsworth get back into the uniform and pena to be himself with his comical side that gave the audience a breath of fresh air in between tense scenes the movie did pull of tension a lot better_than most war movies especially ones that have come out in the past decade possibly and it's non complicated story made it fun and interesting to allow the story to be driven mainly by the characters after the introduction.not the best made movie but great story.given what joss had to work with courtesy of man of steel and bvs i think his ability to put any lipstick on this pretentious cheerless swine of a franchise is admirable is it derivative only if you call a movie with villain with horns on his helmet trying to take over the world with a glowing cube and a borrowed army from another villain derivative but the team dynamic is solid and the team actually act like super heroes not just rehashes of nolan's batman aquaman is a truculent door kicker like he is in the 90 s jla show the flash cracks jokes and runs fast wonder woman is competent compassionate nurturing and stubborn batman is frank calculating pragmatic and unflappable and superman when he finally acts like superman is great it takes a while the resurrection is a painfully grating detour and given joss work on buffy it smacks too much of the familiar but the resurrection trauma doesn't drag forever and clark eventually assumes the role he has always meant to be the man of steel the man of tomorrow the guy who believed in truth justice and the american way finally after two dumpster fires capitalizing on superman's good name we get to see the op og himself when that moment happens the movie falls into place the team becomes the team the big six minus the lantern for everything the story gets right despite zack's pretentious pratfalls in previous films i give it a solid c close enough joss better luck next time.great war film the acting was top_notch paired with an awesome score and filled with superb visuals this gives me a renewed appreciation of the men and women who put everything on the line for this country.the critics who gave this film low scores are out of touch with people that actually watch movies and are pretentious douchebags.great storyline good special_effects jerry bruckmeimer normally triumphs in these movies 13_hours black_hawk down this movie was disappointing pena hensworth did not deliver pena a green beret please could not connect to any of the characters especially when the climax was an injured soldier getting loaded on the chopper i was expecting to love this movie sadly disappointed but any movie that shows our troops in a good light is worth 3 stars must_see true_story about our military special_forces sit down hold on and get blown away by this moving movie.a fucking embarrassment of idiocy written by a 14 year old who stepped out of a time machine from 1985 using all the worst hoo rah cliches in the book movie summary 9_11 words words words loud noises murica nobody dies snore.best movie in a long timedecent war movie that told a story i hadn't yet heard of which was interesting however it feels like too much of the film was jumbled shots of firefights and not enough building of the characters themselves i know it's based_on a true_story but i never felt attached to any of these_men being portrayed comparing it to other war movies like black_hawk down hacksaw ridge and american_sniper it just doesn't pack the same punch.excellent movie and knowing it was based_on a true_story made the experience even better what these 12 soldiers accomplished was nothing short of a miracle.the critics are on lsd or jealous of a documentary movie made to wow the audience with all the theatrical pizazz.excellent story so glad this movie was made to tell this classified story that went largely untold and swept under the rug these_guys changed the history of the world 12 did a great job of telling a almost too crazy to believe story about the first soldiers that were sent down range after 9_11 it did an excellent job of showing how complex the political landscape in afghanistan was without becoming political or preachy the action_sequences were good the story was good however the characters were a bit shallow if you like war movies you'll enjoy this if you're looking for forrest gump level character_development this isn't for you 12_strong r 2 10 is also known as 12_strong the declassified true_story of the horse_soldiers which tells movie fans much of what they need to know in deciding whether or not to see the film here's the rest of what you probably need to know these 12 army special_forces soldiers played by among others chris_hemsworth michael pe\\xc3\\xb1a the great michael_shannon trevante_rhodes and the underrated geoff stults become the first american troops to strike back against the taliban in afghanistan after the sept 11 terrorist_attacks barely a month after the towers came down two army officers rob riggle and william fichtner choose this group of men to link up with a northern afghan warlord navid_negahban to attack the important city of mazar e sharif this film has a lot in common and compares very well with another film released in mid january of 2016 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi both films give us heroes to cheer for and plenty of intense action while mining the backgrounds of the men involved and their complex interpersonal relationships for considerable emotional impact 12_strong is thrilling entertaining heart felt and serves as a great reminder of the courage and determination of the men and women who defend the homeland by fighting overseas a the leftist media and that includes movie critics is so obsessed with trump that they can't even think their approach to this movie is would a movie about american valor be good or bad for trump figuring it's the former they give it negative reviews they pollute everything with their political views their negative reviews are a ringing endorsement and i'm going to see it this afternoon.exciting absorbing heroism for anybody that has american patriotism in their hearts some people don't unfortunately.i really enjoyed this film i thought cast was strong storyline fit well and the character_development was great.i thought it was a good movie it had a few feel good moments but a good amount of action i wouldn't say it would top the classes like apocalypse now or saving_private ryan but i definitely recommend it.captain mitch nelson is a true american hero what a wonderful movie that perfectly embodies self less sacrifice love of god love of family and patriotism liberal americans hate so much i would give it more stars if i could i stand with these american heros if you dislike this movie you're un american.i feel like this could have_been so much better but instead what i saw was a mass of cliches the dialogue was often terrible with standard lines given i will return to you wife and i would follow you anywhere my brother soldier my ally we had differences at first but now we are great friends i couldn't help but groan inside plus i felt no real connection to the characters so when the action scenes occur i felt no concern for the those concern the afghans were just extras and the horse_soldiers themselves were shallow or total enigmas then we have the villain the al_qaeda commander the perfect representation of a mustache twirling baddie he is introduced in such a hamfisted and brutal way that what was supposed to be a powerful appearance went over flatly i wasn't angered or frightened by his actions just irritated at how the scene was executed with such great source material its a shame to be let down here.i love this movie and fuck the criticfull of action beautiful inspiring movie.proud to be an american.an ok war movie that told a story i was not familiar with so that made the movie somewhat appealing to me normally i love michael_shannon michael pena and chris_hemsworth but there wasn't a lot to their characters in this movie i'm not one that normally needs a lot of character_development in a war movie but it was noticeable in this film i still find ways to care for the characters in a war film and this film lacked in that area i enjoyed the action scene and i respect the story it was telling but it's not something i was to revisit.great war film with good action and a simple to follow story the shot structure at_times is a bit muddled and can be confusing and the vfx are cheap at_times but a great new age true stroy war film overall.it was ok another war movie set in the middle_east shows the hopelessness of a war in the middle_east with a nod to how hard it is for the families back home.in the spirit of doolittle's raid on tokyo during world war ii but perhaps more statically important well_acted though i suspect some content was for dramatic effect the quote in the movie leave afghanistan and you are cowards stay and you are our enemies has the ring of truth to it and a true_story as well.it's easy to forget but america is still at war as each year brings us further away from the shock of 9_11 it becomes harder to grasp its impact 12_strong tries to remind us how much everything changed by being the same old war film.what does separate 12_strong from most action movies is its depiction of afghanistan culture shock is the true driving force behind this movie it motivates much of the humor and the drama by far the most suspenseful scenes are when the freshly arrived americans can't understand the locals intentions on the technical side this movie is scenery chewing in its attempt to make afghanistan a character in its own right it can't_help but constantly provide sweeping vistas of the mountains and battlefields dust gets used to set a literal fog of war things do get excessive to the point where it seems like the camera only moves so much to give an excuse to show off the lens flare effects 5 times in a single shot.this repetitiveness extends to the action as well after the 3rd battle scene you start to expect that you're seeing the same footage as the previous two 12_strong is the most michael_bay film i've_seen that wasn't directed by michael_bay it can't_help itself but show off excessive amounts of explosions and fighters gunning each_other down this is a war movie after all but 12_strong is so caught up in its jingoism that it neglects everything else non essential scenes are skimmed over in order to get straight to the next fight most of the characters get very little characterization and their families appear so rarely it's unclear why they're in the movie at all it's also clear that chris_hemsworth was cast for his star power rather than merit it's not that his acting is bad so much that his accent keeps slipping even worse is the character of general dostum having seen the documentary the convoy of death it's bizarre to see dostum lionized as a battle hardened leader when immediately after this movie's events he had 2,000 prisoners of war massacred of course this movie depends on its moral clarity so anything more than glossing over dostum's war crimes which by the way american soldiers also participated in would only get in the way of this movie's goals that simplicity prevents 12_strong from being a truly great or even competent war film.as a desert storm vet i can say that this movie captures some reality the relationship_between the oda captain and the general he is assigned to rings home they have some initial questions about each_other and the core thing is that the young inexperienced capt who is introduced to war has to get his killer eyes like heart of darkness on which apocalypse now is based the young captain goes on a journey some lessons learned include that afghan fighters fight with a belief and heart that the next life has more to offer than the present life where as the americans may not have faith in a life after the current one this indeed does make a fierce fighter if they do not mind death because it may be better_than the world they currently live in americans fight to survive but the afghans fight for a better world at all costs including death there was also the lesson that if america leaves they are cowards and if we stay we become the enemy america almost always leaves and the after math is seldom good for those who assisted and believed in us the backstories about the family at home is also very real my dad was also a war veteran and i remember him leaving as well as my departures from home we are still in country in afghanistan years and years later we have told them we are leaving but then we stayed and now it looks like pakistan may be next jan 2018 i believe this move walked a fine balance between history entertainment and politics but it also did not shy away from what the fighting warrior goes through weekend athletes and professional athletes and even people in high paid careers talk about being warriors this move show a small tiny slice of what being a real warrior is they were outnumbered they were out gunned and the air war did not prevent them from going in nose to nose and eye to eye killer eyes was intended to imply that you are no longer naive it would be nice if most of the critics and people in the world were looking deeper and less naive as well the balance this movie walked is a thin line and i found it better_than american_sniper or hurt_locker by a long shot the characters were more real the political narrative was not in your face and the action and tech was spot on.great cinematography novel story in that few were aware until nowof their role post_9 1 well_acted directed bruckheimer nailed it.an awesome story of courage masculinity and a willingness to take on life's burdens ideals that aren't valued by hollywood elites which is why they give the score that they do.tells a good story about true american heroes.it was a great movie i really enjoyed it reading some post on here makes me wonder i know now to not believe every review it was a really good movie with a lot of action this review is from a veteran so please read because all these other reviews shows that most of you obviously have never been through a mission nor actually know what real combat is like 12_strong is a true_story of 12 special_forces men who completed a mission that was supposed to take 2 years and did it in 21 days yes this did really happen yes there is downtime even in combat trust me this is coming from a fellow vet the story is true and they did use horses in combat and to ride if you don't_know afghanistan it is very treacherous terrain and this is why they used the horses also they were able to use them for sneak attacks and close combat fighting this movie is great and its finally great to see a movie that finally accurately depicts a battle from one of the more recent operations great job all around and don't listen to the critics they are wrong about this one of course they don't understand war and what soldiers go through great movie all around was ok nothing special the bad guy was kinda weak in character though since this was based_on a true_story i can't blame them too much you don't want to demonize too much especially in a conflict that is about as clear as mud so watch it if you like war movies or just chris hemsworth.awesome film based_on the facts of the true story12 strong the true life story of how after 9_11 the u.s government sent a group of 12 special_forces members on a mission to take a taliban hot spot within 3 weeks chris_hemsworth thor leads the charge with a excellent supporting_cast with micheal shannon the shape of water micheal pena end of watch and navid_negahban homeland the story itself is captivating but the mistake here is the telling the story as commercial as possible this could have a been a tv movie by the producers bruckhiemer's company that tel the film as if it was one this is a american story the error is americanising the telling of it in the usual fashion if they could have told the story in a independent gritty way it could have_been totally absorbing mel gibson made big choices of how hacksaw ridge would have to play out in two halves and the second is full out absorbing horrific war spielberg made saving_private ryan visually 12_strong features almost tv coverage from the swirling aerials pans and dolls shots by fails to have a distinctive independent style or vibe the film's true life story is well worth telling and in the hands of someone like joe carnahan narc for instance it could have really found it's tone by trying to look and feel like every other commercial film it loses chance to be truly original like it's source story one sequence in particular where the soldiers charge the taliban with missiles flying over their heads is a thrilling set piece this shot pov or normandy beach style from saving_private ryan's opening could have_been a masterpiece of a cinematic battle a by the numbers style war film of a truly remarkable achievement it's not a bad film by any means it just fails to be as remarkable as the achievement that was made in the story if the filmmakers had been as fearless as the real_life heroes who knows how daring this could have_been a nice touch is showing the statue dedicated to the soldiers at the 9_11 site fitting tribute.solid cheesy in some parts but good.i didn't know much about this film before i went to see it so had no expectations i was unaware obviously of this mission into afghanistan due to it's classified nature until now it was amazing that these 12 men went in and within a couple of weeks accomplished their mission which many thought would take months they showed real grit and bravery in taking on the taliban at_times in hand to hand combat on horseback i have seen many war movies few really capture for me the essence of what it might have_been like to be right there in it i think this film does that.overall a good movie i had a few issues with it as i'm sure there are a few embellishments but that's what sells tickets.hollywood white savior of the world again.good solid action film and true to boot if you like watching americans fighting and beating evil you'll like this movie.the leftist movie criditcs will always vote down any movie that shows real hero's against radical islamic aka the religion of hategood movie lots of action and a excellent and inspiring story.good not great but a really good final battle scene.amazing story based_on an amazing situation that captures the reality of the time great movie great cast fast_paced i was on the fence about this one but glad i went to see it i recommend it 12_strong is a beautifully filmed and entertaining movie set in the aftermath of the 9_11 attacks the movie explores the 12 men who were sent to afghanistan to embark on a dangerous mission chris_hemsworth shines as captain mitch nelson and is proving he is very capable of diverse rules as he is most famous for his portrayal as thor the rest of the characters are explored in significantly less detail which is understandable given the sheer number of characters however the moments we do get with the other soldiers are enjoyable especially ben milo's trevante_rhodes relationship with a local boy the cinematography is the strongest element of the film with the action_sequences being intense and thrilling there are many eye_opening moments in the film giving insight into the horrors of the taliban and their ways there is also a realization that the operation is more complex than the americans initially realized there are cultural and political conflicts within the region such as the rivalries within the northern alliance which the americans try to stay clear of overall 12_strong is very enjoyable and an excellent portrayal of another american hero story the cinematography is beautiful chris_hemsworth is solid as nelson and the rest of the characters are modest enough in the limited screen time they receive 12_strong was amazing people can say this is just to add new life to the 9.11 rhetoric but let me tell you this film is about people who looked death in the face and rode right down their throats war isn't for everyone but the tales of heroic acts in the face of death are so compelling especially when the story is true.it is a great story that deserves to be told nevertheless something seems amiss in this movie it could not lock us into the movie.great movie true depiction of heroeslove stories of heroism great cast based_on a true_story makes me want to read the book to fill in the details.good performances delivered by the cast and a mostly enjoyable film if you are into gritty war films pacing seems to be off somewhat but for me did not affect my enjoyment of the film.it may have_been embelished for hollywood its a movie after all but the shear feat of conquering the geography and the communication and cultural barriers they did let alone while being shot at by opposition forces is almost impossible to imagine but its a true_story so deal with it and an excellent one at that for those critics that poo poo it was too tactical not enough action unrealistic that no ne of the 12 died a it was a true_story they didn t die b you should go up in those same mountains and have 100 or so hostiles fire ak 47 s at you while you hide behind rocks and see how realistic that feels enuf saidexcellent true_story with an authentic feel.a great reminder of how to get a war story done right.this was a good war film it helps you understand how hard it is to tell the bad from the good people the fighting is great with the effects and it makes you feel hire hard the soldiers worked in the battles.the hemsworth thing cant act but he didnt get much help from the script either disjointed and rather herky jerky seemed that the story was too big for the script to manage so it fell back on cliche and the usual programmatic gimmicks entertaining in general but fails to capture the heart of the story and instead embellishes with bad guys reapeatesly running into machine gun fire and rediculous horseback one handed ahooting gallery antics a shame it reall is an amazing story that is a testament to our brave and deeply skilled special_forces soldiers.although the movie was decent and had a great cast it slipped into biopic generic ness pretty quickly there was a good story here but there was no real character development.a bit of a hokey white washed version of a based_on true event movie great cast is wasted by first time director.this is one of the greatest war movies ever made it can be a little unrealistic but though most of the film you get a good idea of the war in the early stages don't listen to the critics this is worth your time.strong story line alot of solid actors who did a great job great military movie especially impressive that it is based off of true events highly recommend.the loss track of the story a little bit but over all very good.phenomenal movie great cast and a insight into what building relationships in war is about.solid good movie providing a glimpse into what these_guys had to face in this battle the story is more important than the movie nuances but showed the unconventional battle due to terrain alone that seems unlike other wars leaving from the base at k2 in helicopters scene was significant to me could the verbiage and character exchanges be more indepth sure but it would make a longer movie showing the disconnect between washington dc and field commanders was good and the difficulty our men face in battles and war highly_recommend if you like war movies.true story depicts the rugged terrain caves physical geography and challenges of war in afghanistan along with tribal disputes and personalities appreciated humility and training of usa military in our first response to 9_11 attacks see this film.this is one awesome patriotic all american and well made film go see it very well told from the perspective of someone who was there.good writing great staging full depth of characterization.critics have the issue that they are more interested in what really does not matter to a movie goer they want the science of art rather than the art itself 73 of moviegoers liked this movie and yet only 58 of critics did proof is in the numbers just like most of what we see now very well made and good performances.looks extremely exciting once_again the professional mainstream critics vs the audience is at a disparity like last jedi this time the critics didn't care for 12_strong but more of the general audience did 12_strong has a strong consistent plot likeable characters some realistic military tactics mixed with a hollywood splash of drama overall i liked this movie a lot all the actors gave competent performances the special_effects used a lot of practical effects which was a nice touch and the story made you care for not only the characters but the outcome of the story highly recommend.it's fun and interesting to see chris_hemsworth play this character as i know him as that god of thunder guy with the hammer him and all the actors play these characters incredibly well though the writing could of helped bring more depth to the characters.the story is fascinating based_on the events after 9_11 though i'm unsure how dramatised this movie is it's genuinely immersive to follow.the action in this film was really incredible better then i was expecting though in some scenes it could have_been even better.a must watch.much action worth the view.mer like 12_strong young hansom young strong hansom boyzamazing story great cast so glad i saw this one at the movies a poorly written snooze fest film in 12_strong we see thor son of odin tackle his biggest threat yet:a nefarious group of militia the movie really tries to make yo empathize with the operation all i saw was wasted tax dollars and life the terrorists responsible for 9_11 were not even from afghanistan i'm tired of the military hero worship.entertaining non fiction war movie which bring to life the pictures of special_forces soldiers photographed on horseback that made the rounds a few years back.if you are looking for an action pack war movie this is a pretty good one are there scenes that are kind of exaggerated or unbelievable ending climatic last ride into battle you bet but for the most part i felt it was well_done one of the nagging thought that bugs me most of the film is why are there no high altitude spy planes or even spy satellite coverage over the theater of operation of such a crucial operation especially when the whole we own the sky was repeated quite a few times or is that not declassified yet.awesome critics are only bashing it because of their political bias great flick must see.tells the story very poorly12 strong is a very pleasant film for people to watch with very great acting a good story and amazing realistic action.grade aeveryone knows that once the twin towers were attacked on september_11 2001 soldiers went into battle and wars have_been occurring ever since that part is well known by everyone around the world these wars will soon be talked about in history classes if they aren't already so it goes without question that films will be made about certain aspects of the war due to the significant impact that it has left and continues to leave the story that 12_strong presents is something that has been classified until recently so it should be quite the surprise to many there are many aspects about this film that follow the standard war film formula but as long as it's supported by a solid cast great sequences and solid direction the premise itself should be enough to carry its audience and i believe it does just that now playing in theatres here's why i think 12_strong deserves a watch even if not immediately.following the first twelve men that stood up to make the first attacks after the collapse of the twin towers back in 2001 this movie explores the true_story of courage and ambition that these_men displayed for the world as a film it does feel slightly formulaic due to the fact that it pretty much takes you from one location to another in a fairly simple way but i can also see this being exactly what went down in reality so i was able to forgive that flawed aspect pretty quickly this is a film about intensity and the characters surrounding that intensity and for that it succeeds with flying colors.from chris_hemsworth to michael pena michael_shannon to a fair newcomer in trevante_rhodes whom i loved in 2016 s moonlight this is a stacked film i always appreciate when a movie delivers crazy amounts of action while also finding the time to slow down and give each character their moments to shine no the character_development here isn't anything to write home about but i have to admit that i was wrapped up in each of their stories simple moments of characters sitting by a fire and reminiscing gets to me if it's done well and 12_strong accomplishes these feats quite well.this movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart in terms of gore or being turned off by too much action because when this movie wishes to display its reign of terror on the people who have some sort of involvement in the terrorist_attacks 12_strong does it in a very visceral manner from showing executions to showing towns being bombed i found this movie to be a fresh dose of reality to people who seem to forget about the horrors that go on around the world on a daily basis as i said there's nothing spectacular about this movie but i think it's a little more important than people are making it out to be.although director michael_bay hit a high point in his career with the film 13_hours at_least in my_opinion i feel that 12_strong is a film that shows real promise for director nicolai_fuglsig this is his first mainstream outing and i have to call it as i see it and say that i believe this man knows how to portray action on screen and i can't wait to see the progression of his career as a filmmaker in terms of action i would recommend keeping an eye on this name for the future overall 12_strong is a solid and important war flick when it comes to the core story and i believe everyone should check it out at some point but i could also recommend quite a few better movies in the same genre impressive filmmaking but just good as a whole.best movie i have seen in a long time it can be a little slow at_times but overall a really worthwhile experience.color me surprised it's no longer january but wow this january definitely delivered on some great films it took me a while to get out and see this one but man i'm glad i did the action in this film especially late in the second act is outstanding some of the finer action_sequences in a war film i've_seen the music by lorne balfe really adds to these sequences and helps keep you on the edge of your_seat amazing cast chris_hemsworth michael_shannon michael pe\\xc3\\xb1a trevante_rhodes all give such great performances here every character has something important to do and no one is relegated to being comedic relief each scene carries great weight but what i appreciate most is that the politics of the time taking place in afghanistan immediately after the september_11 attacks really move the story forward cia paramilitary officers and u.s special_forces joining the afghan northern alliance and disagreeing on many field tactics the moments that really hit home with the dialogue lie in the characters truly believing the their mission's success would completely crush taliban forces and end the war in afghanistan in just a few weeks time we all know how this turned out but of course there's no way in 2001 any of these soldiers could have known what would lie ahead this is another excellent war film from jerry bruckheimer and i highly_recommend checking it out wish i'd seen it on tv too loud too busy unless you want to know how it feels to be in battle.solid film with excellent cast amazing that it is a real story 12_strong is based_on the book horse_soldiers which is the true_story of a previously classified operation by the green beret dagger squad who were deployed to afghanistan shortly after the september_11 2001 terror attacks this brutal and realistic war film stars chris_hemsworth thor the avengers films as captain mitch neelson and oscar nominee michael_shannon the shape of water revolutionary road nocturnal animals as chief warrant officer hal spencer in a nutshell this movie was incredible because not many people know this story it is unique from other true_story war films for instance in darkest hour you know what's going to happen based_on settled and widely reported history for this film many people are still mostly unaware of these details so this film is riveting and full of suspense the idea of soldiers on horses facing the taliban with tanks is something that i suspect most americans would be quite surprised to see while this film has the chance of becoming jingoistic or pro war like a certain film that came out this weekend it manages to be a realistic and powerful commentary on the war on terror without pushing any sort of pro war or american exceptionalist agenda on the contrary 12_strong manages to pragmatically illustrate the problems of regime change and destabilization in the middle_east you can't go into afghanistan and change it into a mini america also worthy of mention is michael pe\\xc3\\xb1a for his performance as sam diller the squad's comic relief tastefully written dialogue and masterfully performed and who can leave out retired united_states marine corps reserve officer and current side splitting comedian rob riggle who easily transitions into a world of drama and gives a stunning performance in a serious role overall 12_strong was a terrific movie my score is a 7.5 10 definitely go see this movie in theaters while it's still there an excellent film somewhat unrealistic to me stick to thor movies hemsworth battle scenes were beyond ridiculous did you know that you can beat tanks with horses me neither because it never happened.en dehors d'une s\\xc3\\xa9quence de guerre assez muscl\\xc3\\xa9e avec un v\\xc3\\xa9hicule lance roquettes 12_strong est un film l\\xc3\\xa9nifiant qui encha\\xc3\\xaene les poncifs pendant deux heures cr\\xc3\\xa9ant des personnages aussi inint\\xc3\\xa9ressants les uns que les autres chris_hemsworth est toujours aussi nul en leading role et le reste du casting tente de s'approprier les miettes que le sc\\xc3\\xa9nario leur laisse mais en l'\\xc3\\xa9tat le film de nicolai_fuglsig n'est rien de plus qu'un ennui mortel entrecoup\\xc3\\xa9 de s\\xc3\\xa9quences d'action plut\\xc3\\xb4t efficaces dommage pour taylor sheridan et william fichtner qui livrent de tr\\xc3\\xa8s bonnes prestations.the story would be incredible even if half of it were true loved it all the way through.bad acting but the movie itself was good also like a lot of other moviesonce again critics prove that they can't be trusted to be honest about a war movie they tend to throw out buzz words that have no meaning all the while ignoring the fact that these are real people the fact is professional soldiers don't look at the world the same way as a professional critic they also don't act talk or live the same way instead they live like soldiers what 12_strong does is show professional soldiers doing their unconventional job and the unconventional struggles that come along with it leaving family behind getting along with allies of a different culture and background and ultimately the violence of war 12_strong delivers strong individual characters and a strong story.debated between 2.5 and 3 but held my attention enough to give it the bump gonna see this my friend said it was good most of the far left critics hate anything that shows america as strong and courageous.very enjoyable movie do not know how close to true it was but a piece of history i did not know enough about makes me want to learn more about it and thats as good as you can ask for a based_on true_story movie if you are just seeing one movie this month this is a good choice.solid action movie acting was better_than i expected.this movie is excellent the courage resolve and toughness of our special_forces is something that will inspire you and make you realize once_again that american servicemen and women are real_life heroes i had not heard of the horse_soldiers and this is a story worth knowing and a movie worth going to god_bless america i really enjoyed this movie probably hemsworths best performance to date.overall ok movie kinda forgettable but still entertaining enough i did like the history of this though would of never done the research if i never heard of this movie.been to see it a few times battle scenes are really good saw it in rpx with seat shakers the 1st time great recount of events strong cast.the movie is an incredible display of courage and guts it doesn't need anything else other than to tell you exactly what_happened and how it happened and how lucky these_men were to survive would recommend 12_strong is an adrenaline charged war drama based_on a true_story of a group of special_forces soldiers deployed after 9_11 to take down the taliban can't complain over the ensemble_cast filled with my_favourite actors like chris_hemsworth michael_shannon and michael pena but it's navid_negahban as general dostum who is the scene stealer for me my grief about the film the pacing was too workman like and uninspired the script lacked depth and the delivery was almost boring and lacked a strong climactic end the 12_strong men certainly deserved better these_guys are real heroes entertaining good fun even_though the last battle was far fetched.really enjoyed this movie.great movie folks a must_see this movie was outstanding at the end when the photo of the real guys the 12 was shown most of the audience applauded i thought we should have given them a standing ovation i am shocked by the 54 rating from the critics i have to say i believe that reflects a bias of some kind go see it for yourself preferable in the theater you will not regret it good interesting but no blackhawk downaction packed great movie.another war movie full of battle.great movie highly recommendit was so so there are better movies than this.a reasonably strong action movie here the reviewers got it right.do you think it was weird for hemsworth to constantly be referred to as cap seriously though what these_men did was incredible and director nicolai_fuglsig finds an effective way to convey as much even if it takes him a good portion of the running_time to find his footing.amazing story line based_on a true_story a must see.really enjoyed this movie i did not know this story before going but have done more reading about it afterwards these_guys deserve recognition for what they did.well crafted much better_than the trailer made it seem never a dull moment i left surprised at how an a story as important as this has never been told.some good action scenes and the premise trailer was intriguing especially since the movie was based_on true events characters seemed underdeveloped and left me not caring about the facts.should win the best movie it was done so well and it's a true_story there is a monument at the one world trade center it's a movie we should be proud of seeing because it also reflects what american bravery and heart look like ps i don't agree with the last part of the not enough to balance a disappointing lack of depth or nuance what the heck does that mean the movie was and is awesome true hero's don't need anything else was a good movie as a marine and wounded warrior i feel this movie did well in its representation of service memebers.had good action and acting but where this movie fell flat for me was its lack of depth.the execution is great here we learn about these people their personalities and throughout the movie see them evolve the action scenes are done really well there are many battle scenes and the camerawork puts you right into the action it's exciting and makes you really respect these soldiers they rode on horseback against tanks and other high end weapons not to mention that they were often outnumbered my only issues with this movie is that the pacing is a little uneven in areas dialogue was hard to hear at_times due to somewhat subpar sound mixing and in general this movie doesn't stand out much from other war movies mind you though these are only minor issues 12_strong is a mostly good war movie with good acting fantastic action and a story that makes you really respect these men.nationalist nonsense don't bother.strong story marvelous acting specially chris_hemsworth emotionaltypical us propaganda but the production values were high spent a lot of money on the battle scenes and the eye candy aussie hunk chris kept my girlfriend happy was surprised though that the cinema was empty hemsworth is a totally different god of thunder in this one really bringing the rain with explosions and gunfights non stop.great movie detailing america's special_forces and the role they played in afghanistan post 911 the cinematography and content of the film is enchanting.interesting story good acting just shot in a real war porn kinda way like america fuck yeah style.i am really no sucker for war movies but this one is absolutely cleverly made with great conflict scenes which at_least to me as a layman look quite real entertaining and without too much emphasis on this typical american heroism nonsense shot in great locations of new mexico which actually give the feel of afghanistan 7 of 10 points.i can't speak on the accuracy it's your standard biopic action movie.really entertaining movie locked in the whole time pretty suspenseful at_times based_on a true story.this is certainly a story worth telling about a group of twelve soldiers who rode into battles on horsebacks in the middle of afghanistan the film does a good job at showing those battles and the journey they traveled it it full of cliches however and fails to give a personality or depth to a single character.full on action all the way this was on my watch list glad i got to see it 12_strong might have worked as an big budget episode for a war television series but as a 2 hour movie it just feels very derivative of any depth its a lot of explosions that lead nowhere and the horses don't much about that.thor raiding among enemies shooting his gun and dropping bombs.why did i expect some depth in this movie silly me it it an americanata and it's amazing how a story based_on facts can feel so fake.explosion and lame sentences for more than 2 hours the explosions are good though enjoyable enough with a good cast but it still seems to contain all the usual war movie clich\\xc3\\xa9s which means that it really must be based loosely on real events.predictable contrivedtypical american heroic movieamazing story of 12 brave and lucky green berets.ask yourself if you would have done what they did adapt and overcome saddle up it's worth the ride.for an 8 ticket you get 12 worth of entertainment.cap mitch could have_been played by a woman with his seeming impervious to bullets bombs rockets etc like he had an invisible shield and superhuman powers as most women are portrayed today.an action film along the lines of transformers little realism but lots of explosions.our yearly by the books war film is here this story of bravery adaptation and unlikely alliance is momentous and frankly deserving of a much better screenplay it unfortunately hits the same beats as a lot of these procedural war films and not in any new or interesting ways especially in regards to character and exposition that being said the directing and action is proficient even_though its repetition can be burdening the cast and performances are substantial as well despite some wasted talent namely michael_shannon and trevante_rhodes all in all 12_strong is worth it for the narrative and for parts of the way its told.generic war film but competent enough.horrible didn't live up to expectations no peak no poiintini berdasarkan kisah nyata tapi perasaan film'a terlalu berlebihan sih berasa ga bisa dikalahin banget ini tentara as apalagi si kris gila doi punya nyawa banyak banget gitu hahathis is what happenes when you take on a huge superhero charecer then make a diffrent movie.typical all american blue eyed boy war movie with no real substance the plot may based_on a true_story but i guarantee you will be yawning in a seen this all before way come the mid point that's when i turned it off.wow way to dumb down a really complex situation to america fu k yeah this movie is so stupid kind of like america.a decent film however a script that won't come near to the true life experiences from the soldiers lacking depth is hollywood code for lacks gay actors bashing the united_states constitution go watch the movie and rejoice knowing america still has brave_men doing good thingsa powerful story about america's hero's don't let the critics fool you this is an inspirational movie with kick ass scenes.not at all an accurate account of the doug stanton historical book sensationalized fictional representations misrepresented historical events as with lone_survivor the truth would be more inspirational where is any reference to the book's depictions and sacrifice of michael spann another typical war story that offers nothing new entertaining but nothing that will ever be remembered.one of the best movies of the year the fact that it is based_on a true_story makes it more incredible a lot of movies of this genre can be hard to follow with military talk but this was not the case with 12_strong must_see thrilling and intelligent the story itself if it indeed was the way it is pictured or something not too far removed from it is incredible but i didn't find the cast particularly well picked nor did i find the movie entertaining beyond being barely watchable perhaps it should have focused on the war more and less on juicy dialogues and scenes bordering on cliches.not many moviemakers can claim a movie this powerful as their first crack at directing chris_hemsworth plays captain mitch nelson who led a band of green berets who fight along side an afghan warlord and his men against impossible odds to overthrow another warlord in his heavily fortified stronghold i liked the fact that they were forced to use horses in their mission while calling in airstrikes from american warplanes this is a military story of courage and determination reminiscent of the great tales of world war ii good cast and plenty of action in the forbidding landscape of afghanistan.this film shows us how much we owe to those who risk their_lives in defense of america.awesome performances from all the cast hemsworth had a great chemistry maybe with every actor in the movie pe\\xc3\\xb1a every joke he delivered hit the mark but it's navid_negahban as general dostum who is the scene stealer for me such a good actor and a very attractive character.there are a lot of very strong moments that really surprised me but unfortunately not all of them are edited well which shift the tone pf the movie here and there.good and intense action set_pieces and extremely beautiful cinematography.the major issue i have is the dialogue it's very very very clich\\xc3\\xa9d and corny specially when it comes to the dramatic dialogue that almost ruined the whole first act but also after that there are many well worn rude jokes and cheesy soldiers talk that i couldn't bear.also the antagonist lacks depth a couple of scenes to show that it's a ruthless character aren't enough to make it a compelling and strong one 7 10 i tried to enjoy the movie but american heroes are all covered up i guess this one was too much war too little emotions and people for a fiction even if it was based_on true events i really got bored.proposant une tr\\xc3\\xa8s solide distribution 12 strongs s'av\\xc3\\xa8re un film de guerre assez bien r\\xc3\\xa9ussis malgr\\xc3\\xa9 un certain manque de profondeur mais il compense tout de m\\xc3\\xaame par de bonnes intentions et une histoire int\\xc3\\xa9ressante.the idea and premise behind the movie is great but the portrayal of it grinds on slowly i believe the selection of actors in this film were good right up to chris_hemsworth and rob riggle two characters who i believe hurt the movie hemsworth just can't get away from thor and riggle will always be know as a comedic actor or the extra the one character that i personally loved in this film was michael_shannon he brings grit and like general abdul describes in the film the look of a killer all in all the film finishes strong but lacks the thematic elements to make it great if you are a history buff or an war movie addict you will appreciate the film but if your a braveheart saving_private ryan war type gore seeker this film will leave you with a sense of not that impressed all in all this is a great story done well but not great worth_watching but not a second time.a really good movie i would have liked more detail.so much potential wasted.i watched it with no idea about the movie i must say i was so impressed with it i don't care what they wrote after watching it saying they keep doing the same stuff im sure the taliban didn't say to these 12 guys ok guys we will give you a easy level if you pass next is medium then hard last i thought it was eventful action_packed and well worth watchingwhat would these idiot who reviewed it really know you guys suck for poor reviewi knew nothing about this movie until the previews and it did not disappoint what a horrible place.fabulous i was in the edge of my_seat our military does not receive the respect deserve12 strong muscles its way to victory great flick.cliche also considering the fact that westerners have_been exploiting and generally screwing over the middle_east for decades it's hard to get behind the usa usa usa perspective.this movie is a little long but it's also very good one my second watch i felt like it gets too slow and boring in some parts but maybe it's trying to convey that this actually took_place over a longer period of time it's not quite a classic like we were soldiers but it's an extremely solid film the ending of the movie is really what catapults this movie into being more than what it is initially.crappy movie bad acting unrealistic and bad special_effects just another military hero cash in quick hollywood garbage flick this movie was ok but the over the top cinema crap took the movie to a different realm no way does he ever have to go down towards the enemy to give coordinates they had a lazer device to let the planes know where the enemy is.just wasn't very good.very good dont miss this one we still have american warriors12 strong is an incredible true_story with intense sequencing.i was pleasantly surprised by 12_strong i feared it looked like another simple advertisement for the united_states military but it actually has a lot of heart it dares to show how horrifying and implausible the situation was on the battlefield they take on america's perspective post_9 11 with a tender touch and a firm response you get to see how this team captain had to use diplomacy to win over an afghani warlord the writing is balanced and gives you the perspective of both_sides in this alliance you see the extremity of the enemy side as well as the stakes of the allies it is intriguing at every moment and keeps you deep in suspense 12_strong may start out slow in its introduction but it picks up speed quickly once it reaches the desert battlefield any cliche characters leave and the film comes into its own the characters are simplistic types in general but they are well played with heart so i think most movie goers can forgive 12 strong's pretty thin character traits to get to the action and deeper narrative being told harrowing fight after fight will stun and please audiences everywhere the gunfire is intense and the combat is frighteningly realistic you see airstrikes missile launches gunfire and numerous other hectic situations the action is non_stop once it gets going until the end.powerhouse performances lead the charge in 12_strong most notably navid_negahban delivers an absolute masterclass in acting as the afghani warlord loathing the taliban his fierce command and steady presence leaves you impressed he also dives into his motivations and the cause of his people he is highly sympathetic and simply a delight to watch i hope we see negahban's career skyrocket after his brilliant displays of acting in 12_strong and legion.chris hemsworth makes for a compelling lead you understand his motives and he keeps you engaged in the moment michael_shannon and trevante_rhodes round out the standout performances in 12 strong's supporting_cast you get to see some remarkable demonstrations of dramatic intensity serious delivery and even some fun humor mixed in nicely it's a strong ensemble overall 12_strong makes up for its amateur cgi in moments with dazzling practical effects and nightmarish onslaughts of modern_warfare the action and visual effects are quite thrilling i think most viewers will be strapped to their seats during 12 strong's combat you actually feel like you are in the middle of a war zone with bullets and zipping past your head.director nicolai_fuglsig should be commended for his even hand in empathy and brilliant cinematography there are many gorgeous shots of scenery explosions close ups and even the conversations are well shot i was most pleased to see that some care went into 12 strong's construction it is pretty even in its most dire moments fuglsig's focused direction uplifts the intense action and stunning effects.in short 12_strong makes the most of its excellent actors competent script unbelievable story gripping action solid direction and historical significance if you can get past the slow start in the beginning half_hour of set up the end justifies the means if you can forgive the basic characterization of the characters and appreciate the greater story 12_strong tells you will enjoy the rest it is a film worth seeing once.slow and predictable somewhat interesting but overall pretty bland and generic.one of the few recent war movies where nobody had to reload seemed everyone had a full clip throughout the movie.hemsworth does a good job.just a weird war movie too hollywood make you trying to laugh and create a plot that didn't really exist poor directorsis it just me or was anyone else thinking that someone should grab a sketch pad and pencil or even a digital sketch pad and draw the suspect 12_strong with chris_hemsworth is a must_see adventure war film not bad but not good either poorly written.the true to life story is remarkable but i don't get it how hollywood screwed up the movie it's hallow and lifeless.this was a good movie about the aftermath of 9_11 but the biggest issue i have is no one that portrayed the military wore a helmet at.all having missiles and martyrs blowing up the military actors being thrown about with no helmet and not getting hurt was stupid note they did inot defeat the taliban in this movie.complete crap it lacked real world military tempo as well as a plot.great movie made even better by basis in actual_events yes there may have_been some liberties taken in the re telling but it is great to finally have some well crafted films that honestly show historical events without the pc focus on self loathing if nothing else our military families deserve that 2018 5 14 the story was okay but the way it's filmed just like an american hero movie otherwise it's worth watching.the other war horse so unless you are an extremely young child you know about 9_11 what you probably don't_know about is the first strike america launched back at terrorism in afghanistan as it only recently got declassified this is the story of the twelve soldiers who rode horses due to the rocky terrain and worked with a warlord navid_negahban in an effort to hit the taliban where it hurts it kind of turns me off when a movie hits you with images from 9_11 in the opening minutes i didn't like when they did it in zero_dark thirty and i didn't care for it her either i get why they did it as it is 100 the driving force of the film but it still comes off as cheap emotional manipulation that said that is the least of this movie's problems as this is a mostly generic war movie when you get introduced to all these characters every one of them with the exception of michael_shannon comes off as being bro y which is something i deduct points for there is a lot of macho testosterone going around and it really doesn't help that they aren't written to have any personality so it becomes exceedingly difficult to tell these soldiers apart you really only get to know about four or five of them when you break it down and most of them you only recognize because you have seen the actors before chris_hemsworth michael_shannon and michael pe\\xc3\\xb1a are the top three who get the most screen time and you get a little bit from trevante_rhodes not only because he's the only black person but also because he is given a minor subplot the other eight soldiers i couldn't tell one apart from the other they're all just stereotypical white military people that you've seen in hundreds of movies before the most interesting angle to this is hemsworth trying to convince this warlord to trust him for mutual success but it only plays a small part in what this movie is all about because this movie has nothing distinctive about it it ends up lacking any flavor there's no identity to this and it ends up being indistinguishable from any michael_bay jerry bruckheimer produced war movie filled with explosions 12_strong never breaches that realm of being terrible like the 15 17 to paris does and at the very least it is always watchable but who can recommend that you watch a 130 minute movie that is bland and unremarkable i am not a great fan of the action genre and for all the reasons this film epitomizes the heroes are all 100 percent heroic funny strong and the villians 100 percent evil the americans are all the ridiculously valiant and the afghans even the good guys just mildly so and the heroes are constantly running through torrents of bullets unscathed in totally not believable situations.a bit too unrealistic for my taste the action is dull and repetitive the story is watered down it's worth_watching but really only if you were doing something else and it's just kind of on in the background rent it don't buy it.this movie is some lame foreign attempt to capitalize on the american soldier the characters all look like they know the ether bunny in a biblical way.although nothing more than a traditionally shallow war pic that verges on propaganda there's not anything remarkably bad about 12_strong fun action is always good.about as mediocre in story and character as you expect from a film like this it's typical war action porn with a complete lack of substance in anything on a more political or thoughtful level not even hemsworth or shannon can outshine its severely dull and repetitive elements we've seen a thousand times in every other patriotic historic modern war film.hollywood continues the tradition of milking its tragedies for box office revenue with 12_strong the tragedy in question 9_11 has been covered from many angles and this time round we get the story of the immediate response team sent behind enemy lines to help dismantle the taliban a brave mission undertaken by exceptionally brave individuals unfortunately reduced to another dime a dozen war flick it's doesn't quite have the same jingoism that often plagues films like this since the american soldiers are technically there to help out and not to save the day there's several instances of laughably bad cgi popping up this fact was clearly noticed by the editing department who try and cut the shots as short as possible so as to mask it unfortunately much like with mac and me it's hard to have a body dummy or cgi fall convincingly right in front of us what starts out as a tribute to an elite squad who did the near impossible in such a short space of time is reduced to a series of battles so simplistic that the film may as well be retitled bad guys fire at good guys good guys fire back chris_hemsworth is as likable as ever but we never get to know many of the soldiers despite the cast having some pretty big names it's certainly competently assembled and the director wisely avoids filling the battles with unnecessary shaky_cam but it lacks the personal insight of american_sniper or the palpable tension of lone_survivor it's a fascinating true_story turned into a medal of honour video game level only you never get to play.lots of action once the movie gets going what i have not heard from other reviewers the movie slows not only the power of weaponry but the fortunate quality of life in the western world clearly contrasted by the lives of the afghanis who appear to be continually immersed in war and violence in a hardscrabble mountainous desert region.the film maybe should have minimized the pre insertion aspects even more than it did and devoted those extra 5 10 minutes building the alliance between nelson and his team and dostum and his fighters.other than that a good ridesome movies do a poor job of tracking the action making it hard to comprehend what is happening in real time it usually comes down to editing but the editor is limited to what can be done based_on the footage they are given by the director.sorry but last_30 minutes of this movie completely destroyed it.if you like military action movies then you'll love this.it was a decent action flick too bad these films are always so politically divided that people either love it or hate it base on their political views rather than an honest critique.it was slow in some parts and the action scenes were that as gripping in comparison to say 13_hours or black_hawk down arguably the best film bay has ever made while that's not necessarily saying it's perfect bay shows that he actually can make a movie that isn't a colossal waste of time.amazing movie well made and to the point coveying the chaos of war and the cost.impressive get to know these_guys get to love these_guys get to know how difficult it is to know who's with you and who isn't it's intense and for a movie that is this long it will feel a bit longer this is simply because when you're under fire seconds seem like hours it's a ride of action and emotion.could have had more character_development but it was amazing and the fact that it's true makes me in awe of these brave_men and mad that our govt didn't do more couple of moments put there intentionally to keep it apolitical didn't care for that but overall great.my mom wanted to see this movie and i bought us a big tub of popcorn that we munched on during the previews but we didn't eat any during the movie we couldn't this is an intense gripping movie based_on the book by the cia operators who were there and also involved in the making of this movie it's a great story of personal team heroism of failed leadership of failed gov and of liars must_see four and a half stars and not five because the movie is a little too real see before you review great movie.great flick sad story told well not a diatribe just a telling of the story you draw your own conclusions about the obama admin and clinton involvementriveting not a dull movement.right wing propaganda if anythingexcellent movie how can these liberal critics give it mediocre ratings idiots like clinton and obama.i felt the desperation and frustration these_men must have experienced.amazing movie those soldiers were absolute the bravest men in the world hillary_clinton is a lying shit bag every word out of her mouth is a lie.riveting sad chapter in american history.very solid war movie i'm no judge if it was factual but it was well made.but they don't touch the politics at all not one bit missed opportunity.horrible movie one of the worst waste of money.extremely well_done curious why critics rated in the 50s proves they're more biased toward the liberal progressive way of thought i.e obama and hillary fans the action_sequences as you would expect from michael_bay are amazing great powerful the tactics by the enemy attackers are also revealed in thorough detail but the critics are right on this one aside from the action the script is full of thinly veiled political jabs horribly predictable banter between the hired guns the stuff you'd expect to hear in the background playing a shooters game on 360 and the obligatory calls and facetime scenes to the families back home are so contrived and so utterly staged i felt like those were the best times to get up to take a piss the events leading_up were very confusing actions by bad guys highly implausible guns dealer and all of the characters had parts to play but were not complex in the way a story and events like this should be portrayed the blonde is vehemently against the grunt like gunman and then becomes a fierce defender of them the cia station chief is a complete and total pencil pusher who is adamant on staying there after the sh_t hit the fan and one little word of get in the f__king truck changed his mind immediately and 20_minutes later he has something poignant to say to that warrior the whole firefight was extremely engaging but everything else around it felt staged from the very first ride in benghazi with the two main guns for hire the dialogue at the roadblock going into the tunnel was ripped right out of an early eighties bad paramilitary movie even stallone in a new expendables script would look at those lines and say nobody says that sh_t'michael bay of the awful transformers movie actually directs a half decent movie here about the benghazi embassy attack in libya this movie very much a straight ahead war action movie is about the cia operators who defend the cia station there.it's a by the numbers movie about the heroism of these secret_soldiers and the rescue effort it's a violent sometimes confusing highly masculine movie that isn't without a few tender or well chosen moments but it remains really just a retread of blackhawk_down but without the assured touch of an old master like ridley scott.a touch overly long and in places a bit silly this is still a decent movie on modern warfare.my girlfriend and i were extremely impressed with this movie the action is non_stop the story is amazing even more so because it's based_on a true_story lot software familiar faces in this one loved the action and extremely intense moments.hollywood liberals won't like this movie because it makes the obama administration and hillary look bad i saw it yesterday with a family member and we both enjoyed it it's a well made movie a truly great film i left the theater speechless and at the same time filled with thanksgiving for the brave_men and women who fight the good fight to protect the innocent.gripping movie informative would see it againwouldn't have ever thought i'd like a michael_bay movie but here it is the expected americana rah rah over patriotism didn't happen except for the tattered flag in the pool at the end for the most part seemed to be a true quality portrayal of a stressful story only thing missing was a sassy subtle shot of hillary on her blackberry in the background.read the book bone up on the actual event b4 you go to the moviemust see to know what_happened on the ground.very moving bring tissues seeing this makes me feel less safe as an american we have people running our_country with absolutely no moral compass and no sound judgment god help our great nation.de las pocas peliculas de guerra q puedo decir q si me gusto mucho riveting performances believable special effects.usually when you see the words a michael_bay film the words mature and subtle don't really pop in your head and yet with 13_hours despite the fact that it doesn't go further than being an action movie that's exactly what you'll find.thoroughly gripping and even more suspenseful than i expected director did a great job of telling the story and honoring those who fought bravely everyone clapped at the end in appreciation.this was a great movie great acting and action so many unsung heros we have in our country.not sure what movie the critics watched this was a powerful movie and a great tribute to fallen and wounded heroes whose government failed them i enjoyed it thoroughly and was moved.it's an amazing look into the cia and the bravery of contract soldiers to protect insane bureaucrats.excellent acting and a gripping story of true life hero's.i saw this because i had seen everything else but also because i knew nothing about benghazi i'm embarrassed to say and i liked john_krasinski so much in away we go and guess what i was not disappointed at all a whole lot of testosterone flowing around special ops everyone is brother and has a beard because this was a true_story i was more interested and forgiving of some of the fictionalized melodrama also without giving anything away i felt like there was more emotion expressed over the guys who died than there probably was in real_life but that's ok it was a tribute i went to google right after to check the facts.this movie was amazing it made me laugh cry and so angry at_times i wanted to scream michael_bay did a fantastic job honoring the fallen and respecting what was done there.powerful movie not political makes you appreciate the true heroes who protect us highly recommended.outstanding movie recommend for americans.haven't seen it yet the ratings and comments by the so called critics of this website are not surprising given their prior rating on all things sjw.good but not great movie.there were parts i really liked and some i didnt worth seeing but not as good as it could have been.most of the critics are probably liberal i loved this movie p.s don't vote for hillary.a bit chaotic but i'm sure the real situation was far more so.the real_life soldiers portrayed in this film have said that they wouldn't add a thing.and it's a story that needed to be told.pround to be a servicemanproud to be an american this film causes more anger to rise up our_government is useless and hates it's people jesus is our only hope.amazing story telling so much was hid from the american people when this happened this is must seeoverall a good biographical war movie not up there with black_hawk down or saving_private ryan but still it was quite entertaining and honestly this category of films had been lacking in my_opinion over the last few years so i was really looking forward to seeing it and left quite satisfied the director distinguished himself by not presuming to spoon feed a conclusion as to the political questions surrounding this story to the audience he presented a factual account of what_happened and what did not happen i.e any attempt whatsoever by the most powerful nation on earth to protect or assist in the defense of it's public servants under attack on foreign soil from a dramatic point of view i thought the first part of the movie setup a very uplifting and believable transition on the part of the effete ivy league over achievers who constituted the diplomatic mission and their green collar protectors.until things started to get hot their disdain for their mercenary body guards was thinly veiled in the final hours of the fire fight their visceral appreciation of the heroism required of those six men in order to save all their_lives was clearly in evidence unfortunately once returned to the safe environs of washington d.c few if any of them have_been willing to risk their exorbitant compensation and entitlements as government bureaucrats by coming forward and testifying as to what really happened on that day if bo bergdahl deserves a court marshal for what he did in afghanistan what should be the penalty for a command in chief who goes awol while american citizens sent by him to one of the most_dangerous places on earth are under enemy fire on the battle field it would be a hanging offense if the cic is hiding out in his residential quarters at the white house i guess we're expected to call it something else even_though i've studied the accounts of these events carefully i'm very glad i saw the film i know war is hell and i'm grateful for every anonymous us military volunteer who comes home alive and unscathed at the end of his or her tour but this movie reminds us how lucky we are to have a military tradition which aspires to preserve humanity and honors self sacrifice above all else of these brothers and sisters of ours who protect all we have and all we are we can and must be rightly proud.say what you will about michael_bay but the man knows how to do an action movie in my_opinion this is his best movie to date it has all the hallmarks of a michael_bay movie the explosions the car chases etc but it also comes with a maturity rarely seen in his earlier movies i sometimes got the feeling from his movies that some of the action_sequences were there purely as eye candy and didn't really contribute to the story there is none of that here the action is indeed relentless but it really does help illustrate the hopelessness of the whole situation forget the critics opinions on this movie this is most definitely worth going to see.if deciding whether or not to see this great film please don't make the mistake of reading reviews from the syndicated hero hating hillary supporting crydicks this is a great movie which trends in the correct political direction without actually insulting your independent intelligence by overtly telling you who is to blame for the tragedy portrayed we all know and that secret conclusion is well enough for you to simply sit back and feel secure in knowing that millions of other 13_hours watchers agree with you the hideous bottom out of this story is the disdainful ignorance on the part of governmental squatters who sat silent as american blood stained yet another foreign hell hole when i walked out of the theater i found myself hoping that when these attacks happen in america and they will these ferociously courageous beautiful warriors would be there to protect me while the other side of my lavishly patriotic freedom loving sentiment truly hopes the critics of this movie who call it right wing will soon come to understand why they are able to have such a disgusting opinion because men like those portrayed in the is film gave them the right to be idiots make no mistake critics hating on this great cinematic work don't hate the movie as much as they hate what it stands for the blood ransom paid by those far worthier than them and by those more deserving of the life they squander in their unadulterated hatred for american culture but then again if you are like the rest of us who are right you too will find yourself rooting for the american fight against the islamic zombie horde to which no doubt many of the dissenters of this film belong and support.this is a good movie i so think it's weird it came out 2 weeks before primary because it boasts republicans thoughts overall a great performance one of michael_bay's better movies which is saying a lot krasinzki proves he is more than just jim halpert from the office i would see it again.solid movie with a basically accurate storyline of the real events action was ok but as with most hollywood movies some of it was a little inaccurate.all in all a good story and good action movie a tale of true events that touched many peoples lives this is an important story about a handful of american heroes with little support and no backup from our inept government they still never considered for a second about quitting and they fought the good fight this film will leave you pissed drained but more than anything proud that we've got men willing to lay it all on the line for others drained must_see it was interesting and cool to see this story told in a movie most of which i did not know the details of but it was really long with a lot of boring parts and horrible pacing this movie seriously should've been at_least 45_minutes shorter the action really wasn't even that good and there was some of michael_bay's usual cheesy dialogue and moments spoilersone good thing i will point out is that this movie did show how sad it was even for the attackers that died and their families and it also showed that not all libyan people supported this kind of violence 1 viewing the first act is boring but the rest is quite intense.best pure war movie in years.this should be required viewing for anyone voting for a new commander in chief even_though it masterfully stays away from the political side of things you can't_help but think that while all this going on our president went to bed american did not send help and or secretary of state of asked what difference does it make you were on edge the whole time such a dangerous place such brave_men and women and such a sad result it did a great job of letting us possibly sense what it was like to have_been there go see it for sure the two hours goes so fast make you dislike hillary and obama even more they did nothing intense and thought provokingamazing such brave menlet's face it it sucks period.everyone should see the truthpowerful movie full of impact a must see.truly a great movie about our history great movie i was full of emotion watching this the behavior of those brave_men made me proud to be an american but i was also so angry that our_government turned their backs on those guys no help came i do not buy the left wing narrative of nothing could have made it i can do math and 13_hours is plenty of time for plane to get there from europe and even the eastern us.finally those brave_men get their due hillary_clinton should go to prison for leaving those people behind to die super movie with a lot of actionmichael bay is a household name regardless of how you feel about him he's known for bombastic overblown and exciting action pictures with plenty of explosions he gets the action bits right in 13_hours but the movie suffers from pacing and cliches such as a scene in which all the soldiers are talking with their loved ones which is about as manipulative as one can get in a story writer chuck hogan adapts a book but the cliches are forefront such as overly gung ho bravado tough_guys who scoff in the face of danger and david_costabile who is literally just a strict opposition force with no dimension whatsoever his only purpose is to disagree with the soldiers at all times for added conflict that is not needed the movie's action_sequences are plentiful and thrilling but the movie's emotional core is not quite right you could do a lot worse than 13_hours but its not the new war film classic not by a long shot 13_hours is a great movie by far michael_bay's best movie he's done so far there's a lot of good some bad in this movie the last 2 acts of the movie were way better_than the first i found the character_development great the characters were likable people as always michael_bay likes to add his humor although it really isn't that great some hit but others really don't he seems to love a lot use a lot of shaky_cam which is the worst kind of cinematography to use in a action film it's best to keep your audience entertained instead of leaving them dizzy luckily the shaky_cam wasn't there all the time the action in this very good gruesome at_times reminds a little bit of lone_survivor john_krasinski does a good job in this movie as well for james_badge dale who has one cheesy line but is awesome in this movie the rest of the supporting_cast was great too i enjoyed my time at the theater michael_bay really redeems himself with this movie 4 out of 5 very intense 4 out of 5 very intense.one of the most intense movies_i've ever_seen thanks michael_bay for presenting the facts in a non political way super sad events great movie.a very violent war movie or at_least the 2nd half it drags on for about 40_minutes before it gets going the action scenes were decent and there was this awesome one where the camera follows a mortar shell which was really cool lots of the scenes didn't make sense like when they are rescuing that american ambassador he was in the fire but they never confirmed he died until the end of the movie the most annoying thing i thought was when the soldiers kept saying oh are those guys friendlies they said that about 6 times i think they were trying to make this as realistic as possible maybe that is what the soldier really went through overall it was ok but does drag on a lot.certainly a film that touched many consciences one has only to read the critics reviews to see their criticisms are grounded more in politics than movie making didn't go expecting a documentary wasn't disappointed.let's not forget this is a true_story of how our state_department sat still while four united_states citizens were killed i just can not forgive those in who allowed this to happen i'm sorry for that but it's how i feel.must see no denying the cowardice of our dear leaders.top notch it was important that the public know the truth of how the administration threw its people under the bus for what was clearly a lost cause for 13_hours those in charge sat on their hands and allowed these patriots to be massacred it's no surprise many critics want to call this a fictional account the media goverment incest is well known i did have problems with the lazy writing and the ubiquitous profanity which seems to substitute for toughness these days it was long but it covered a lot.best movie i've_seen in a loooong time beats the renenant easily great acting great filming great effects and it's a true_story that every american needs to see regardless of your political beliefs.what could be a war porn bay action procedural never loses its tension nor its biting political undercurrent if black_hawk down was a thinking man's war movie reflecting on elite soldiers left hanging by a clinton in the face of an armed african mob 13_hours delivers a similar election year juxtaposition for the other clinton almost an h is silent in benghazi attack ad in film form i love bay's new turn of his style choosing to do true events movies so i loved this one but mayb didn't have to be 2 n half hours long otherwise would be 5starsgreat movie obvious critic_reviews were based_on personal biasi was on the edge of my_seat the whole movie joins black_hawk down in the canon of spectacularly good modern war films it's not without minor nitpicks the odd constructed sentimental moment an irksome historical detail adjustment and the odd bit of soldiering that looks more dad's army than navy_seals but there's no 4.75 rating so it gets 5 stars.michael bay does what he can with a complicated story and makes it and enjoyable moving going experiencei felt like i knew just as much walking out of this movie than walking ina tense and gripping war film from director michael_bay which is easily his best film since the rock.based on the non fiction book by mitchel zuckoff telling the true_story of the battle of benghazi on sept 11 2012 islamic militants attack the u.s consulate in benghazi_libya killing ambassador j christopher stevens and sean smith an officer for the foreign service stationed less than one mile away are members of the annex security_team former soldiers assigned to protect operatives and diplomats in the city as the assault rages on the six men engage the combatants in a fierce firefight to save the lives of the remaining americans.the action is stunningly recreated as bullets ping off walls rpg's fly over head bays chaotic style is used to good effect here as events unfold nobody knows who is friend or enemy.stand out scenes include militants sneaking up on the compound in night_vision and a shot following a mortar shell all the way from launcher to target.if i had to nitpick the film is maybe a little too_long and like the similar black_hawk down mentioned by name in this film more is made of one american death than hundreds of faceless enemies.but make no mistake this is an energising and thrilling action film it deserves to be seen and should be seen by as many people as possible as the true events it depicts need to be acknowledged.on this evidence bay should stick to directing people not robots.let me first start off by saying that before i get into any negatives which are slim i am going to be giving this film an overwhelmingly positive review 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi follows six men as they are tasked with going to benghazi to protect the men serving against all odds and against their jurisdiction they must flea their site when an attack begins after an american ambassador is killed at a u.s compound this crew tries to figure out exactly what is going on while trying to stay alive and protect their people.directed by michael_bay and being released in mid january should have_been two big red flags due to the fact that this is the time of year when studios have no faith in their products i must say with little to no product placement humour placed in the right places for the most part and a cast that will have you in tears due to their realistic portrayals of these characters 13_hours is easily my_favourite film i have seen this january yes there are a few hiccups here and there when they maybe did not have to crack as many jokes in certain moments and a few slow_motion shots felt out of place there are very few of those moments however aside from those complaints this film had a surprisingly tight script and gripping action_sequences it may feel slightly long to some viewers but that is just michael_bay's style i thought this movie was great from start to finish words i did not expect to say 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is terrific and emotional wish guys like this were running for president.solid solid film by michael_bay telling this story and how our_government both republicans and democrats let our boys down was something that needed to be told the action is amazing and classic bay but the story and brotherhood that is shown throughout the film is awe inspiring honestly one of bay's_best films john_krasinski does a great job in his first action role the cast is superb and honestly one of the better action films in recent memory.this was a great movie great actors great action scenes and great storyline it's sad how incompetent our_government is and that americans died because of our presidents inaction.interesting but the director put too much camp goofiness intentionally or non intentionally into what should've been a more serious movie.my wife daughter her friends and i thought it was great it was important to give the viewer background on the ex military now contractors lives so you related to them as husbands and fathers before you saw them as heroes i think the liberal critics are downgrading the film for obvious reasons.the movie is good don't let the critic_reviews steer you away there are pros to this movie but i'll just list the 2 cons the build_up to the action takes forever and the movie is really long normally i like long movies but this one stretched the film in areas i wouldn't overall i did enjoy this film even_though my review would appear to show otherwise.hace tiempo que bay no hac\\xc3\\xada algo que valga la pena 4 5totally awesome movie.i went to see this movie with my boyfriend someone who has been in a paramilitary group like this one he actually trained with one of the men from the film he said the accuracy of the environment and what actually happens out there was pretty much spot on i teared up in this movie john_krasinski did a great job with his role and has grown so much as an actor the legitimacy of the film and what these_men had to endure is just heartbreaking definitely a must_see it opens your mind to what really happens out there.it should be a law that every american should see this movie.amazing people cheering in the audience very patriotic very suspenseful recommended for my friends and family to go see.an absolute must_see remember the americans who defend true heroes whether acknowledged or not thank you for reminding me of the pride i have in what americans can be.a quite intense movie not as negative on the obama ministration as i am anticipated although it did show the complete failure of america to save it citizens.as an old army officer that spent 2 years in the sandbox i was struck by the visceral authenticity of the experience they presented i had also watch the 5 part interview and the movie is absolutely consistent with the story they told michael_bay did a great job brining to life without getting bogged down in the politics of it.great movie it shows once_again the sacrifices our service members make and the lack of respect they get for those sacrifices hopefully it will open more eyes to what is going on for our american men and women.boring and the characters were never really introduced just a shoot em up nothing this movie left me feeling so sad and angry at the same time us govt never showed up for them hillary should hang for this.check the reviewers the liberal press is ripping this movie it points the blame without naming the obvious names a beautifully done story to honor those brave menalthough drenched in over the top action and a shaky script 13_hours is a gritty war film and shows michael_bay at his best.must see what courage the one thing michael_bay gets right is military action it was the best scenes in the transformer franchise he is on point with this one it is debatable whether this is an accurate account of the events but aren't all movies based_on real_life i'm a news buff i nu what was gonna 2 occur as the dates got closer my heart started pounding very lacking on the melodrama we got a little glimpse between the gaps of the raids yes it needed more so u could invest in the characters but all out very very good.the best michael_bay film since the first bad_boys movie.does anyone else find it funny that it gets a high rating of 87 by audience members and a very low rating by the critics that work for the liberal media so sad they can not even keep some integrity while they do movies reviews.the film was stunning in sense of action scenes and moving in the sense of the wonderful men and women wearing those uniforms.awesome movie our_government sadly seems to be a very disturbing overly large and messed up organization.an effective and mostly realistic action movie that plays out more like a light documentary than an all out bombastic affair strong action pieces and realistic fire fights with good use of real world military tactics and political problems the individuals are portrayed as humans rather than characters and it is their little quirks and light heartedness in the thick out of it that keeps the simple plot moving although not always that exciting to watch the rhythm of the conflicts and down time effectively builds up tension apart from being a bit too_long and laying the emotional set_pieces towards the end too thickly it is a very good film.another great depiction of how well trained men go above and beyond.great characters and blazing action when it kicks in.and once_again they are left to fend without the might of the american military behind them politicians you gotta love them will have to give the book ago to understand more about this event.not quite black_hawk down but much better_than american sniper.great movie that tells a story obviously a bit biased that needs to be heard.one word i would use to describe this movie heroic.i loved it amazingly realistic portrayal of the horror that rained down on our americans with zero outside help that came to their aid god_bless our ambassador and the 3 other americans who died that night.thought it was amazing really informative on exactly what_happened in benghazi for someone who isn't an avid political follower of course the critics shit on this movie because 90 of them will defend hillary the liar.superb film independent of the political overtones the facts behind the story that is told only makes the film better albeit more infuriating great movie showing how we again mishandled a crisis by not reacting.excellent true war story action_packed thought_provoking with emotional ending definitely a must_see wow did not realize where everything took_place and now i have a clearer picture of the facts our poor men and women that sacrifice for country and then our leaders leave them high and dry amazingabsolutely amazing everyone needs to see this movie so riveting.i'm not sure how true this really is but it was well_done i had a bit of trouble telling who was who due to everyone having a beard and bay never showing faces that well when the fighting starts.fantastic telling film well filmed and directed riveting this was quite a surprise going into 13_hours knowing that michael_bay was behind the production i wasn't hoping for great things however he has pulled off his best film in many a year a rather thrilling and well composed action piece.amazing very sad how our_government didn't help them out forget the critics and their personal political agenda i believe these_men a whole lot more than our lying govt look you know what you're going to get going into this film i thought it engaging technically well made and it held my interest honestly i didn't find it that controversial or biased it did reinforce my loathing of any involvement with the middle_east crazies i couldn't care less if they all kill themselves why anyone volunteers to go there is beyond me i do not consider it patriotic in the least let the crazies destroy each_other in the desert not worth one american life imo.i really liked this movie the acting wasn't the greatest of course but the rest was spot on and david_costabile the chief is perfect for the role of a guy that you love to hate he is a prick just like his character in suits i didn't know any facts about the actual event going in so i can't testify to its historic accuracy one thing this movie does is make you feel damn lucky that you don't have to live over there god_bless america folks.excellent action film that makes you proud to be an american at a time when our leaders are making us ashamed to be americans this film helps us to understand the facts in a very complex event in an unbiased way while enjoying a great film.megusta que puede ver las pel\\xc3\\xadcula que vienexcellent action_packed war movie similar to black_hawk down and saving_private ryan.it's a movie that never ends everybody gets their_own little bit to flesh out their characters only their characters are really not all that interesting if it wasn't for the fact that nobody can film an action like bay god this would've_been torture.really an excellent movie acting was incredible you are there wow this movie was intense michael_bay did a great job of putting all the pieces in place before things fall apart for ambassador stevens and his small security detail as they are attacked in benghazi you can't take your eyes off the screen and while he michael_bay goes out of his way not to name hillary obama your left with the understanding that american leadership failed these brave patriots.great movie it really made me sit on the edge of my seat.if the movie accurately portrayed the calls for assistance and the delays in sending help i am sad and it makes my heart heavy that lives were lost i realize that there is a dispute over whether or not the cia station chief held up the response team by close to an hour and when he meets his maker he will then be judged all that said it's a great movie if you liked black_hawk down you will love 13 hours.really enjoyed this.i loved this movie one of michael_bay's best directed movies i liked that it did not politicize the events that occurred but showed the bravery these_men had i could see this being a top 10 movie this year for me.alert alert michael_bay directs a somewhat decent film who would've thought after every rubbish film he has directed you would think he hasn't got it in him to make something worthwhile you would be wrong to a certain extent he has managed to be very mature with this respecting the story and actually making characters who aren't one dimensional for a change it doesn't have the bay humour thats plagued the transformers films or that god awful pain_gain thing he released it still has a few of his bayisms that i wont go into detail mentioning one thing that does ruin it for me was the use of firework explosions stop now its annoying however if he continues down this path maybe the public will start taking him more seriously.great movie that tells a sad true_story about politics of war killing good men hillary and the administration should be ashamed of the disgraceful job they did in protecting americans they put harms way.good action film but ridiculously fictionalized no way 6 guys killed that many libyans.michael mann does 13_hours in the spirit of blackhawk_down better_than i thought it would be wow kept_me on the edge of my_seat very emotional and at the end of the movie there was not a sound in the theater they did a great job with this movie.important story well_acted difficult to watch without screaming about what obviously isn't being wasn't done good movie sad story.the amount of patriotism you feel for these brave_men who risked everything to protect their people and the dignity of the us is unreal.good movie very sad our_government hid all of this and wouldn't help those brave_men bad situation from day one now it's controlled by isisdisappointingly wooden despite some good action at_times michael_bay's films seem to be quite hit or miss and this is the latter.riveting knowing the men involved helped to make this movie made it even better my review of 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi based of true_story the incident at libya when american ambassador killed and the us compound is attacked by the enemy group of soldiers must stop them before come inside find out there secret so must defend the people to protect it how soldiers are courage and brave for there country risking everything michael_bay direct wonderful film of courage and brave too with the cast was well_done performance and brilliant too the action scenes was fantastic too and one bravely movie all time so that my two cents see yea quite good overall and very tense it reminds me a lot of lone_survivor which i also liked the action was shot well and with me knowing nothing about it beforehand really helped with tension this is one of michael_bays better films for sure.very good movie sat on the edge of my seat.exciting for all the wrong reasons it's hard to say i enjoyed it due to the circumstances for which it was made but i think it was superbly made and the acting by john_krasinski and a few others was pretty good.really enjoyed this movie it seemed very realistic i would like to give thanks to all the brave_men and women who have served in our military.awesome too bad it's not politically correct or it would surely be nominated for an oscar of some kind.i think the hillary hypocrite crowd must be writing bad reviews to keep the tomatometer down on this movie let's face it they don't want to admit their mistakes of the past and are perfectly willing to make the same mistakes again so a movie which clearly depicts the abject dereliction of duty by the present administration is too much for them to handle instead of taking a significant inventory of their past mistakes and admit they were wrong they simply choose to bury their heads in the sand great movie which clearly depicts the true heroes of benghazi let's be honest here if it wasn't michael_bay's name attached as director this film would be far more appreciated than it is by critics personally i think it is his best film to date and even_though he employs his customary machine gun style editing to proceedings it is not out of place in such a chaotic milieu at_times it is a claustrophobically tense and exciting war film that captures all the inherent horrors and atrocities of such a situation the cinematography is outstandingly good and despite its hefty running_time it does not outstay its welcome unlike quite a few other recent releases the revenant hateful eight creed leading man john_krasinski is solid with a really good scene with which to flex his acting chops at the end compared to the recent danish film a war the scenes of domesticity come over as fairly cheesy but they are still passable and kept to a minimum the best sequence is a murderous car chase at night that is brilliantly shot and edited for maximum impact it is just one heart pounding example of why the film deserves better_than to be damned with faint praise.outstanding film dont think i blinked for two hours.michael bay and the cast did a terrific job sticking close to the account as it was written in the book hence the length i thought the story was told as was the book in a very apolitical way.the first_half of the film was quite interesting but then it fell apart and became a bit repetitive in the last hour anyhow i would still recommend a watch.awesome and very moving just makes you ask questions if you like this kind of movie adrenaline pumping film based_on tragic events surrounding u.s military adventurism you'll probably like this movie although it's not the best of the genre.i had almost no expectations for this movie for what the story is it sounds like something i would really like to see i hold a lot of interest in films that focus on war they usually tell intriguing stories based_on the experiences of soldiers who have_been through the hardships of war the people who created movies like saving_private ryan full metal jacket black_hawk down and inglourious basterds managed to pull off those qualities really well but with director michael_bay involved it seems like this movie would blow his movies are usually executed terribly especially ones that tell a true_story such as pearl_harbor and pain_gain so since this is a michael_bay movie based_on a true_story i had no interest to see it but i want to review as many movies as i can this year and since this was the best reviewed movie of the weekend i decided to see it 13_hours is not that bad actually i got to say this is probably bay's most mature movie he has made ever he actually took advantage with the story and added a lot of dignity to it for a lot of people their main issue is that the motivations for the soldiers to go after the people that are attacking them were not at all clear but that was actually the whole point it's said that the soldiers don't_know what they're attacking for either so the audience should be unclear of what is going on that was actually very clever but my main issue is that we have almost no time to get to know these people there is not nearly enough development with these characters for us to understand so when they finally go into battle you can't really get as invested nor even care what happens to them when you tell a true_story one of the most important aspects is to get to know these people more so we can connect with them since the characters are based_on real people another thing is that in there is way too much shaky_cam and quick cut editing especially in the first hour it actually gave me a headache the dramatic aspect the movie is going for gave it a good balance with the gritty action but it does at_times get kind of overly sentimental and it doesn't seem very natural all in all 13_hours is probably michael_bay's best movie since the rock which came out almost two decades ago but when you think about it that doesn't really say much since almost all of his movies since then were pretty terrible this is not a movie you need to see i can't really say this is even a good movie in general it left out some of the most important aspects that a film like this should have but if you want to see that michael_bay has finally done something decent or if you're interested in the war genre of movies then give it a watch.grade c this is not a bad movie and very entertaining.very well told visuals were good i hate fight scenes filmed in the dark so you can't see the action and for being a true_story it was surprisingly non political i'd like to go see it a second time.great film that shows the sacrifice this country has made unnecessarily due to the incompetence and blind eye castes by our leaders.great moviemust seeabout a zillion times better_than the critics said see this one for yourself and decide it was devastating.it's a damn shame that the war in the middle_east doesn't pick up cinema popularity like viet nam or wwii did with the exception of course being the thankfully surprising and well deserving show that american_sniper put on anything else coming out of that desert hell hole that american's have occupied on off for the better part of ne'er 30 years is sadly panned by the majority population currently falling out of the top after it's all too brief stint this film looks to be following the sad suit and it truly is sad politics people's feelings and the american's cultural ability to turn the blind out of sight out of mind eye should never take away from films that try to pay homage to the military and what they stand for in this instance 13_hours chronicles the fateful night of september 11th 2012 in benghazi_libya where a us embassy came under the attack of a large islamic force and all that stood in the way of many american lives being lost was a few security personell and a 6 man team of ex military specialists hired on as a privately contracted group of ass kickers the timeless feud of quantity meets quality was tested that night as wave after wave of radical forces crashed against a wall manned by few few that if necessary would lay down their_lives and take as many with them till the bitter end but as much as i respect the story and the people of the military being honored i will unfortunately forever remember this film as a poor man's black_hawk down i don't blame the choice of story as it is as good an ode to the heroes of our military as any i don't blame the acting as all roles were on point with a crazy good serious turn from typically funny man john_krasinski the office i don't blame a lack of intensity grit or visuals that films like these sometimes have issue with i do however blame the writing and overall execution from director michael_bay as he unsuccessfully attempted to control the chaos of the film he is no stranger to pacing action films with his many turns in the bad_boys and transformer franchises this was just a different kind of beast that deserved a finer touch much like again what filmmaker ridley scott put on the table with black_hawk down though it too was unfortunately not given it's due by the general population in the end this was much like my experience a long time ago with the fabeled space mountain roller coaster in the dark ride uncomfortably all over the place and intentionally jerking it's ride taker in every which way direction 13_hours will similarily peak your interest and reak a bad ass novelty about it but underwhelms in the grand scheme of things i'm proud to have a somewhat decent motion picture dedicated to this story these heroes and many more like them but it still needed to be executed better grade b compelling story that should be seen irrespective of your political views excellent acting and direction.really good movie sad that it happened at all amazing super intense but one that sticks with you and makes you think.awesome awesome awesome hilarity is a waste of skinabsolutely outstanding.bit my fingernails way down while watching this one.inspiring story very much worth seeing.a far more mature effort from bay even if this effort is still as over blown and dramatically thin as the rest grade c this movie rocks for an action movie reminds me of blackhawk_down that feeling at the end of the movie of like what the hell just happened to these_guys and why didn't we do more to help that mad angry and sad feeling the acting was spot on and did not take any political fox news b.s they just kept it to the guys on the ground and their issues and actions loved the movie great movie action from beginning to end forget the politics it's a must see.great movie powerful must seethis movie is pretty fun it is maybe a little long and gets slower in the one place story wise that really could have used a pick me up but krasinski is great and the action is a blast.great movie will see it again.very well_done finally the truth takes away all faith in our government.this was a great movie michael_bay was phenomenal in directing the movie i liked the action war sequences a lot because of their bravery of our_country phenomenal movie to see best movie i've_ever seen so far you've got to see this great movie great film superb directing and performances rotten tomato critic's ratings versus viewer's ratings are good example of political bias in journalism and film.when the first posters and trailers for 13_hours were released i expected the film to be atrocious michael_bay taking on another sad historical event just seemed like a terrible combination for me it didn't work the first time pearl harbour surprisingly though 13_hours is actually a solid war film.the acting is decent john_krasinski gives a great performance the supporting_cast though mostly forgettable all give serviceable performances the overall story was pretty interesting considering it was based_on true events that i never knew happened however it felt like the entire 2.5 hour film was based around one massive action scene so the story was pretty uneventful for the first half.michael bay actually directed the film pretty nicely though it still has many michael_bay isms the cinematography was great and there were a number of excellent shots the action was also very well filmed for the most part.i had a few issues with 13_hours firstly the writing wasn't great the dialogue was pretty cheesy and wasn't very convincing the pacing was also very slow at the beginning and the first hour felt snail paced 20 30_minutes of the film could have easily been cut my main issue lies in the action though even_though it was well directed it was very messy and confusing i had no idea what was going on who the bad guys were or what the mission was it was just shooting all over the place for a very long time if it had been more focused it would have_been a much more effective film.those flaws aside 13_hours is michael_bay's best film since the first transformers it is respectful to the event and soldiers well directed and it contains good acting and action check it out if you're interested rating 6.5 10160205 i think i've_seen these stories too often to find inspiration in them don't get me wrong these were inspirational men for doing what they did we should be grateful that the world has people who have the courage to fight tyranny but in all reality they were also paid professional security and knew the risks heroic men with passion and patriotism working in benghazi to earn money and to do the things they were born raised to do it was in their blood and they were warriors unfortunately it's a rough business and sometimes warriors die sadly fools often direct warriors fools who know nothing of fighting on that note these six did amazingly well considering the odds stacked against them and the lack of support they had from our elected representatives government be warned once the action gets rolling this is a violent and graphic film.this was an excellent movie i am certain that it truly helped me follow this particular script style having been exposed to an earlier discussion about it by some involved in its making from my understanding the movie is true to life with just a few questioning some parts of it for instance there is some dispute as to who called for the stand down this should be a teaching film if not already used by such groups as the army war college in lessons learned regarding chain of command and actions to be taken when there is such an admixture of factors agencies locals contractors etc that come to bear the film bears witness to what total chaos can look like i would like to know how the situation could have_been handled better i hope to have my unqualified opinions about a better solution addressed someday dragging ms clinton on the hill to testify for hours and hours does little to answer the questionif this movie is even half true there are so many politicians clinton and obama and high ranking government officials that should be ashamed to face the american people this movie should be seen by all as it tells the true_story of some very heroic americans regardless of political persuasion this film should be seen because our countries heroes often get lost in the political mire.although characters are mildly developed 13_hours is a solid movie from michael_bay genuine respect is given to those who fought and there's an impressive amount of suspenseful drive.a heart wrenching account of an inept government and the consequences of incompetent leadership on it's citizens and military.i think is movie was one of the best michael_bay films michael_bay tones down the explosions and really shows what_happened to the embassy in benghazi and how it unfold the only thing i had a problem with was the characters development there wasn't much and during the film you forget some of the things that the characters have talked about the movie really focuses on the embassy attack and everything that happened after.was really pretty good michael_bay generally sucks but i think he hit his niche with this one good story good action no transformer porno.fantastically written the movie took you in for the whole ride gave you a sense of pride and disappointment for our country.one of michael_bays best other than that a good story but i would prefer it done by a good team who made it mean something.i thought the movie was well put together rolling stone knocks it but what the hell do they know they should stick to their craft music and thats it okay theres some hollywood in it and story line that wasn't in zuchoff's book but bay worked with 3 of the soldiers that were there and that pansy zuchoff wasn't so in my mind i have to believe the three that were boots on the ground and not the state_department which lies and some opinionated at best author another true_story you say wow at this was a good film nice action and a bit of gore.this is michael_bay's best movie since bad_boys iiuser reviews at almost at 90 listen to the people and not the critics who are well under 60 great movie even if you don't_know the background i'd argue if you don't the basis of the movie it'll be better not knowing the ending great main characters filled with emotion outside the chaos of the movie must_see representing perhaps some of the best work of its much reviled director michael_bay 13_hours manages competency while failing to achieve the greatness or impact its backers might have hoped aimed mostly at american conservative audiences it curiously avoids all mention of obama or hillary_clinton and safely places the blame mostly on cia white collar desk jockeys so 13_hours essentially relies upon the old trope of 80 s action movies those damn bureaucrats who just won't let us win our heroes are ex military security personnel who have the unenviable task of defending the doomed consulate in benghazi_libya against overwhelming numbers of islamic militants the heavy dramatic acting is largely done in two notable performances by james_badge dale who was also in the criminally underrated series the pacific and john_krasinski it is quite clear that bay was attempting to make a slower paced and serious film as it far more restrained than his usual output even with a spectacular third_act siege he seems to take inspiration from other directors such as ridley scott black_hawk down and kathryn_bigelow the hurt_locker zero_dark thirty and while this fails to make 13_hours comparable it does result in what is perhaps his best work in decades i'd be willing to debate this versus his action comedy pain_gain though it's probably just a matter of personal preference p.s interesting fact in all the endless debates and finger pointing and the constant droning of four americans killed everyone fails to mention that the security personnel defending the consulate and its annex managed to kill over 100 libyan militants with little more than smalls arms and light cover food for thought.wonderful movie read the book before seeing the movie bay stuck to the eye witness accounts great tribute to the men who fought bravely during he benghazi incident.this movie was a total surprise i liked it i am not a fan of micheal_bay films this is not his typical style of movie usually his movies are all over the place going instantly from serious to sappy and back again with no cohesion at all this time he manages to stay in serious mode the whole time it's about the benghazi disaster but he manages to avoid politics the story is told from the perspective of the contractors who were in charge of security for the cia the cia had an outpost there that was very secretive nobody was supposed to know they were there and they were not allowed to provide support for the us diplomatic_compound just a mile away the contractors were highly trained us special_forces soldiers they rendered what aid they could to the diplomatic_compound then the cia compound itself came under heavy attack by well armed led insurgents it's a very intense movie but well made lots of great characters and action scenes it was very frustrating to see how our_government just left us citizens hung out to dry out there with little no support there are some questions about some of the facts presented so don't use the movie as a documentary about benghazi it's more about the heroism and professionalism of some of our soldiers don't miss it.though it deserves better_than to be stored away in the hurt_locker 13_hours chronicles a harrowing real_life siege while never fully making the audience feel the emotion and stakes of that fateful day sgt joe friday said it best just the facts ma'am just look to the source material investigative reporter mitchell zuckoff's bestselling book of almost the same name which documents the september_11 2012 attack by militants at the american diplomatic_compound in benghazi in great detail rarely if ever editorializes even the subtitle the inside account of what really happened in benghazi strives for straightforwardness the adaptation meanwhile presents these c.i.a contractors as real american heroes along the hyper realistic lines of g.i joe belied by the much more subjective subtitle the secret_soldiers of benghazi and yes brave and nationalistic they may be but filmgoers are smart enough to make that judgment just by watching the truth unfold alone spoonfeeding rarely goes over well when dealing with material this weighty as better examples of films that make more of an honest connection black_hawk down and zero_dark thirty never both present grittily authentic combat with a mostly fact based story to back it up 13_hours on the other hand presents grittily augmented combat with a doctored version of the facts the action and performances hit hard and rarely let up but they do so with a heavy hand behind them.in this r rated drama from director michael_bay bad_boys the rock armageddon an american ambassador gets killed during an attack at a u.s compound in libya as a security_team struggles to make sense out of the chaos never mind rodney dangerfield michael_bay rarely gets respect a remarkable departure for the director who's primarily worked on the transformers series since 2007 his latest film fares better_than his past attempts to document true stories exhibit a pearl_harbor exhibit b pain_gain as much as he dials back his usual overbearing style however some stylistic tics still end up in the final cut to show us the age of innocence kids race through a field in slow_motion with linens swaying in the breeze to show us the age of experience the silhouettes of our contract soldiers march in slow_motion with a setting sun as the background indeed 13_hours waves a flag for us whereby it should just let us watch it naturally wave in the breeze and stir up thoughts and feelings organically.bottom line wag the devil dogawesome movie how our_government failed these few heroes.michael bay's most serious movie while there is still too much emphasis on the explosions i feel he did the soldiers and those involved in the benghazi fights justice even if he did get too light hearted at moments.great movie only because of the quality of the acting and the director this is michael_bay's best movie of all time john kranzinski does an amazing job.realistic and graphic.i felt thirteen hours was well_acted allows you to see what those involved went through it shows the lack of government support without placing blame however where was the state_department president department of defense usa never looked so bad.action packed and my eyes might have leaked just a little bit phenomenal movie it is sickening that hilary clinton and the obama administration allowed this to occur.great movie 10 on scale of 1 to 10 terrific movie makes me proud of the american soldier told from the point of view of the special_forces team charged with guarding the compound it makes you crazy that no one received approval to rescue these people not just the service men but the entire post of people were to be abandoned as a movie i thought it was very good excellent pacing lots of action good acting i absolutely recommend this movie i enjoyed the movie immensely i thought it was well made and very well prorated the subject of the film when individuals that were at the benghazi embassy are involved in the making of the film i have to feel it is more accurate than a politician would lead me to believe.excellent movie lots of action suspenseful and extremely well_done loved it ready to see it again definitely gets you involved in the moment with the feeling and frustration these_guys were facing desperately wanting to jump in and do the job they were assigned to do and then waiting for help to arrive and wondering if it would ever come in time made me want to roll up my sleeves and jump in since our_government clearly was not michael_bay also made an excellent connection with these_guys home life throughout the movie reminding us that they are normal men and women with families that have heroically volunteered there service to protect and fight for this country a service our current administration seems to take for granted and does not deserve the sad part that really hits home is how many opportunities the powers that be had to save these_guys lives and simply didn't it's made very clear that they could of durning the initial attack and chose not to not to mention the many denied request for additional security in months prior like our veterans health care our military only becomes important to the current administration when they can be used as voting currency and then quickly forgotten and left to fend for themselves keep in mind michael_bay worked directly with the individuals from the security council to create the film and document the events as accurately as possible many of the critics were overly harsh on there assessment of the film and many stated michael_bay did an excellent job in making a tasteful film without directly pointing the finger or getting too overly political i think that's missing the entire point the point and purpose of this film was to tell the truth of the events that took_place that night and the most important and thing to take from this film regardless of how the story was told or what political denomination you are affiliated with is that the current administration failed in in protecting these_men because they did not want to retract public statements or risk campaign agendas indicating al_qaeda had been suppressed and was no longer a threat just prior to obamas re election hence the attempt to convince the american people the attack was just an over reaction to a you tube video several days after they confirmed the truth with the libyan president that it was a confirmed al_qaeda attack the benghazi hearings cost the tax payers 5.2 million dollars as stated so many times by the democrats too uncover that truth had the administration told the truth in the first place and not used the event as political leverage there would not been the need for costly hearings and altough tragic and unfortunate the american people would of accepted the outcome the reason why so many americans continue to spotlight this event is because these men's deaths were in vain and a direct consequence of the decisions made by the state_department for reasons of political gain and now that state_department head wants to be elected president in 2016 benghazi hillary's interview for president fail outstanding movie michael_bay is hit or really miss with me this one i found to be a hit would have_been one hell of a shoot to work on never had to see it.worth watching for people who have an understanding of government service very nuance for a movie of this type the action was fairly intense i thought that some of the slow_motion parts were really unnecessary.so after thinking about this movie isn't bad nor great but its simply a good war film it's no black_hawk down or lone_survivor but it is still better_than most modern day war flicks the acting is good scripts not that bad and if these events are they as they say and depict it then it was sure something crazy 3 5action packed suspenseful and had me on the edge of my_seat the whole time if this movie is accurate obama and hillary should face charges.everyone should watch this movievery powerful movie and very realistic i felt as if i were there don't listen to the critics who pays attention to them any more anyway i would go see it againleaves you on the edge of your_seat with suspense what makes it more interesting is that it's all based off a true_story the only negative reviews i have found seem to either be a predisposed bias toward the director or left wing hillary supports who can't handle the reality of what_happened during or after benghazi incident this was a very entertaining movie and worth paying outrageous ticket prices to see on the big screen the fight scene were well choreographed the characters and their back stories made you feel something when the shit finally hit the fan i personally rank this movie right up there with lone_survivor and blackhawk_down another clinton involved fiasco which cost american lives this is the best movie i have seen this year.very gritty and realistic.this was a very good movie.god bless all of the secret soldiers.another verification of the liberal stance of the critics of this movie where audience rating is 87 compared to the 49 critics reviews this movie shows the infantile liberal stance of inability to deal with terrorists bent on killing americans anywhere possible hope you watch this movie to see how you screwed up hillary good but not great there have_been some pretty lofty movies in this genre over the last couple of years enough to raise the bar pretty high nothing wrong with this one it holds its own but as i said the bar is set pretty high.awesome to see why hillary will go to jail liberals will hate it conservatives will love it the fact that critics will say that the story is hard to believe or unbelievable is funny to me this is the story as told by the men that were on the ground that day not the political rhetoric given to us by the president obama and his secretary of state clinton i'm sure if they made a movie and called it hillary and everything in it were the bullsh t she feeds her droned followers it would be critically acclaimed and marvelous with deep honest heartfelt truths of a courageous woman blah_blah blah.the facts are here for everyone to see and hear it's based_on fact and true reporting from those that risked it all for us give them the respect they gave us by risking there lives for our country.will make you proud angry ashamed and sad.excellent movie no matter what side of the political spectrum you fall on.this is not your stereotypical michael_bay explosion city film its in fact a passion project and you can see that in the quality of the piece its centred around a cia_base in benghazi_libya and the six elite ex military guns for hire that have to defend their base from an incoming terrorist attack its a hard hitting film that doesnt even come close to telling the true_story of the events that day great filmmaking that shows michael_bay in a better lightmovie was well conceived but writing left holes in the plot line a tanker couldn't fill but the actors did the best they could with the lines they were given the cavalier portrayal of ex special_forces was believable until the fighting scenes but overall one of the better movies out right now i would recommend it.good movie it will give you a different view of what occurred.this movie was riveting and well_done it shows the men who were willing to act when everything was stacked against them these are true american heroes and the government should be ashamed and disgusted at how they left them to fend for themselves fantastic story told from a real_life perspective a must_see for all americansjust as powerful as lone_survivor and american snipereveryone should turn off the kardashians and go educate themselves on what our_government did or rather didn't do in benghazi people should know the truth and this movie makes the benghazi 4 more than just a quick paragraph buried in the last few pages of a newspaper hillary's what difference does it make sums up how these_men and women were left without hope in a god forsaken land and the 6 heroes who risked everything to save them while our administration lied to the american public to save their_own skin you will leave disgusted and frustrated but still infinitely proud that america has men like these on our side.very good movie having read the book and watched the fox news documentary i was a happy to see that the screen play followed the facts fairly closely although if you weren't familiar with the book or documentary you might have some trouble following it the dramatization was ok i knocked a star off for this aspect it could have_been better love the differential between the audience and the pro critics the usual liberal bias whenever i think of benghazi i wonder how hillary can show her face in public let alone run for president.everyone should watch this movie and see what democratic politics play in the real world.excellent movie and following of the true life eventstense impactful and well_done the best work bay has done in recent memory.ultimately falls flat even if not terrible and has some good characters in it it's boring too_long and has bad writing 13_hours will appeal to some but to others it won't really do much.movie is worth the money and time to see.audience should been made aware of 8 congressional heavy politically republican bias that there was no fighter jets available and no stand down order givenexcellent movie must see.did feel like a michael_bay film example transformers run sam bad ass fight scene where are you sam stupid death scene from stopping the fight to look around and yell this he ran you told him to run what kind of dumbass question is this the pacing made it difficult to see some of the stereotypical oversimplified character_development that other reviews mention i.e the soldier who realizes he needs to prioritize his family more watching it from the perspective that it was a relatively factual from a timeline of events viewpoint devoid of the controversy of which politician knew what when it was a film that highlighted bravery in the face of overwhelming odds coupled with the realistic portrayal of shell shock the movie stood up on its own.great movie so thankful to live in america.wow this movie touched on every emotion that an individual can experience.it also exposes the tragedy of the united_states placing american citizens to do the government's dirty work but when things go south this same government forgets that these americans ever existed not to mention why those who are in the highest of government when this went down are not facing criminal charges.about the critics reviews this is why i never care about the so called critics useless reviews as they have other motivations to like or not like a movie and without fail they did not disappoint me when you see a movie like pride and prejudice and zombies get a higher review than 13_hours then it very evident that they are in the pockets of liberal apoligetic hollywood which made me want to see this movie even more this is a must_see movie for every american to see nevereverforgetbenghazithis is a great movie i recommend a viewing however how did john kransinki get so buff this was top_notch it gave our stud americans the respect they deserve in showing their efficiency discipline and commitment to each_other and it honors their ultimate sacrifice forever and it also boils your anger towards our white house administration for not lifting a finger to help.the films message and heartbreaking story are what to look for when seeing this movie while the cast of actors were decent the movie failed to capture the doomed feeling or the overwhelming odds that these real_life soldiers went threw the movie was respectful of and to the men and their service branches contribution.loved it so hard to blink the truth about what really happened in benghazi excellent movie must_see for every american.fantastic movie wow what anger i have for our_government wowreally terrific film non_stop drama action and intrigue only frustration was that they could have_been more specific at assessing blame and naming names and yes i lean to the conservative side perhaps the poor ratings from critics was due to the awkward feeling throughout the second_half of the movie of the continuous reminder of complete abandonment of us citizens by president obama and secretary of state hillary_clinton as the situation in benghazi deteriorated on a live stream from an unarmed drone knowing they then lied to the american people for weeks to save president obamas re election hillary for president not quite the visual impact of black_hawk down but on par with the hurt_locker zero_dark thirty and american_sniper in terms of quality i left the film moved and sickened by our_government which is likely the unspoken intent of this film's production if anyone wants to pop hilary's balloon this is the needle to do it with it's a bit over dramatic at_times and the lighting is quintessential michael_bay but in his defense the visual drama has to be increased because without actually being there to feel the intensity the audience would otherwise not experience the peril and danger so too without the lighting everything would be lost in the pervasive darkness i typically treat films like these more as reenactments or expositions than entertainment films so with that considered i give it very high marks and i know who i won't be voting for.take away the real story behind it great movie loved the attention to detail on the guns scenes.great movie if you don't get upset at our_government after watching this something is wrong.same bay minus robots.probably michael_bay's best film to date the action is intense and hectic and really makes you understand the frustration of the event.in the news political good action flick \\xc3\\xb0 \\xc3\\xb0 very good movie but very sad how the great usa did nothing to helpexcellent well told story deep characters great action one of the best modern military action movies_i've seen.this might be michael_bay's best movie.a real account of what_happened not the political account.decent telling of the benghazi crisis this really could have_been a good movie instead it is a mess the acting is pretty good but the cinematography is unforgivable with action shots being shot with a still camera and scenes with people sitting and talking being shot in shaky_cam michael_bay doesn't belong anywhere near a serious script.good movie overall but seriously couldn't they find a single arab guy to play amal the translator why get an iranian who can't say one word in arabic nor speak english without letting on that he's persian tons of arabic speakers out there this disappoints meloved it as good as the book must_see prior to election will give you pause before voting for hillary for sure deplorable action from our govt it was an excellent film that entertained and kept you in the edge of your_seat oh yeah i'm a middle aged woman.ofcorse this movie has the amurreca fuck yeah sauce all over it but still the camerawork gunfights and scenery make this movie a very entertainable one to watch i gave this film a high rating because i love these type of films when done well.i thought the acting on all levels was good the story meaningful and powerful.mostly apolitical but important information regarding benghazi you will forget that two of the main characters are from the office jim and roymovie loses its meaning by leaving out the treason of obama and clinton.heartbreaking but so well done.believe it or not this is actually a modern remake of night of the living dead if you swap farmers for u.s soldiers the farmhouse for a covert cia_base and zombies for well islamic extremist zombies.if it was any other director making this besides michael_bay it would have_been better received no thanks to an unwarranted stigma on bay.outstanding and tense film if not mired in all the helpless frustrations of the soldiers in the film well_acted and a great cast michael_bay did a great job putting the story and the intense emotions to screen especially with all the political controversy that this event brought to life.intense loved and was disgusted by our_country great story the closest we may get to the truth the intensity of the action is like blackhawk_down it is worth the watch to see what real american hero's are like.michael bay and the word good are rarely used in the same sentence as one another unless the two words before that are not very however when it comes to the film 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi the words not very become redundant i am not going to sit here and blab on about how amazing the film was because quite frankly it wasn't on the other hand though i am not going to rip it to pieces because it isn't awful in comparison to the rest of the films bay has worked on it it's certainly one of his best although he hasn't set very high standards for himself in my_opinion only armageddon tops it.so let's have a look at the positives the narrative was decent i finally felt some form of emotional attachment to the actors involved something that rarely happens through the non_stop chaos of other bay films you feel some form of attachment instantly to john krasinski's character why you understand and can relate to his situation having to become a contractor again because money is tightening up back at home this is something bay does well the narrative is continuing to refer back to his family again similar to armageddon this doesn't just apply to the character jack_silva but to the all the seven cia contractors involved discussing their families whenever they get the chance even in one scene we jack_silva and tyrone woods discuss their children the literal moment the fighting stops it's because of this you want the characters to prevail you want to see at the end all of them return to their homes it's because of this you are drawn into the film more something i haven't felt whilst watching a bay movie what else makes this film good is the tension the tension that is created in the atmosphere of benghazi the moment krasinski's character is introduced on the flight the atmosphere changes the locals are constantly staring him down no matter where he walks and this makes the audience well it made me anyway feel extremely uncomfortable knowing that such hostility exists when the character hasn't even opened his mouth it's this tension that remains throughout the film that keeps you on the edge of your_seat for the most part however throughout all that praise like i stated at the beginning it's not great it's good but not great why is that i know at the end of the day it seems harsh to criticize as bay is trying to relate this back to a true_story but oh my did the action_sequences drag on i felt like i was in a repetitive time loop replaying the same scene over and over like i say he is trying to base this on a true_story but the narratives for the first_half of the film were decent in themselves with moments where you thought we were about to plough into baymania but suddenly the tension would end you were sat their thinking he's finally changed at last however the moment the attacks occurred you were thrown back into trademark bay i'm pretty sure he dedicates the whole second_half of the film to just shooting and explosions it must have_been a solid 45_minutes of gunfire however it felt like you were going to have to leave the cinema early because the film never looked like getting out of a loop old habits die hard ay film rating 7 10by george mactaggart can follow me on twitter georgemac96 we really liked this fast_paced movie don't listen to the liberal critics who are afraid it's slamming a dem it's not it's a true look at what_happened by those who were there we let them down we didn't go to their aid periodreally good action and war movie although as a real story the characters are not able to make you care about them as well as films like american_sniper still pretty fun movie and an impressive feat for the six mercenaries.i find it funny for people who weren't there to say the facts of this movie are questionable michael_bay the director took a non partisan stance on this film and i would like anyone to call the actual men there liars they stated the facts as is and what_happened in their viewpoint in the film there is no political agenda plus they stand by the order to stand down hillary_clinton has a history of lying and lied to the families and stated this happened due to a video and arab spring now she's saying the families of the fallen are lying and she never said that to their faces dispiccable.dazzling stunning action_packed in what could have_been a sophisticated war movie an examination of foreign policy ideas a serious analysis of the nature of the conflict or a poignant memorial honoring america's servicemen and women 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi instead chooses to take the low road.this big loud overly long movie about the 2012 attacks on a u.s diplomatic_compound in benghazi_libya feels like it's doing nothing more than preaching to the fox news choir instead of honoring the fallen americans this movie did more to dishonor them there's no exploration of the why of the conflict there's only a simplistic dividing line of bad guys and good guys all of director michael_bay's signature shots are here the point of view from a bomb sailing through the air bullets and blood splattered about and lots and lots and lots of big fiery splosions a screen zealots reviewgreat action no mention of obama or hillary though.was a great movie clear on how our_government handled it pretty sad.i feel this film has generated negative reviews simply because it is a michael_bay film and the source material is highly questionable i thoroughly enjoyed this film it depicts the benghazi terrorist_attacks and the 6_men who had the courage to risk their_lives for the people under attack its intense a lot of action a lot of emotions it isn't the best war film but its a pretty decent onei loved this movie i can't wait to buy it for my home collection i really can't believe our_government let these great americans down when there is will there is a way our_government had no political will thanks bo and hc ideologues to the bone.i was just as surprise as everyone else when this movie didn't turn out to be terrible as we expected it to be because when you hear a movie that's directed by michael_bay and being released in january you would expect it to be bad the movie itself isn't good but it is better_than most january movies that we've had.intense actions scenes a great cast inspired by true events and michael_bay without robots make this a must see.excellent movie i enjoyed it a lot13 hours may very well be the greatest modern_warfare movie currently made for the last two decades true stories of warfare have_been turned into amazing movies black_hawk down and the hurt_locker instantly spring to mind but i feel this one certainly tops them all although there is controversy to the historical accuracy of the movie most notably the scene where the annex security_team are told to stand down the controversy is nothing new as the us government have gone against what the team on the ground said happened that's what this movie is it's their experience of the night in benghazi on the anniversary of 9_11 and the bravery they showed i would say they're telling the truth and that's all exactly what this movie depicts the heroism of six men who didn't have to do anything on that night no politics.the movie starts off slow as we are set up with the events leading to the purpose of this secret team of operators in benghazi being introduced to each character and shown through their daily lives through important locations this doesn't last too_long perhaps no more than 30_minutes before bay launches us into the main event with an explosive tense and fast_paced benghazi attack.after having stretches of extraordinary action_sequences placed one after another in his transformers movies here bay settles on the gritty and grounded action that uses spectacle through his unique shots and camera angles something which he probably hasn't done since his earlier movies the rock and pearl_harbor in fact this is his most grounded movie to date and therefore his most powerful and disturbing when these characters are placed in danger you really feel it a sequence involving terrorists trying to burn the ambassador out of his safe haven comes to mind and the consequences feel heavy even when the movie stops for a breather or to rely more on tension such as a series of sniper sequences the excitement doesn't let up this is the kind of action the genre can rarely pull off these days young john mcclane would be proud.and the consequences oh those gut wrenching consequences they are powerful that's the most important part of a war movie isn't it well they're here and they're masterfully done even going as far as breaking the movie's own rules a bit by showing the consequences on the terrorists families as well much like the conjuring 13_hours also uses comedy to lower the tension during quieter moments to bring in something horrifying later on to get the nerves all revved up again peter jackson may have mastered bloody comedy but here bay grounds it in his action and allows us to have a bit of a chuckle at some of the luck the team go through not everyone can aim an rpg launcher under stress.breathtaking in thrills and shocks 13_hours is one hell of a war movie.could be the return of michael baywow what a great movie don't be dissuaded by the fact that this is a michael_bay film the usually bombastic blockbuster director shows a relative level of restraint and integrity in his execution of this intense modern war tale sure there are explosions slow_motion shots and chest thumping moments of heroism but unlike his increasingly egregious directorial flourishes in the transformers series here they are comparatively controlled and organic bay's propensity for overlong runtimes results in a repetitiveness that dampens the third act's power however he executes the gun battles with enough ferocity and immediacy to maintain the immersion chuck hogan's screenplay adapted from mitchell zuckoff's novel doesn't bring anything new to the genre yet he adeptly avoids clich\\xc3\\xa9s through grounded characters and authentic interactions a little less finger pointing would've_been great though akin to peter berg's lone_survivor this libyan set true_story relies heavily on the core group's chemistry and relatability to elevate the simple premise into a more affecting and interesting combat picture james_badge dale and john_krasinski lead the pack as long time mates who miss their families but love their job both bringing emotional heft and sincerity to roles which also required bulked up physical transformations the other notable cast member is pablo_schreiber of orange is the new black fame who imbues his team joker with a surprising amount of depth and gravitas whilst also delivering most of the movie's levity it's not in the same league as the great motion pictures depicting war nevertheless 13_hours is a kinetic adrenaline pumping and compelling yarn that offers a solid cinematic viewing experience.excellent movie excellent acing excellent filmography thankfully it was not a political movie one way or the other just what_happened and what they had to deal with i highly recommend.great movie great actors never a dull moment moving depiction of real_life events.once again ignore the critics on this one this movie offers an inside look at the very preventable tragedy that took_place in libya i give it 4 stars only because it lacks the necessary bravery of exposing this administration for its lack of accountability in protecting american lives hillary_clinton should be in prison for letting these americans die.watching this it's hard to believe it's a michael_bay movie as an urban combat film and i honestly can't believe i'm saying this it holds its own next to black_hawk down in fact except for the outside political undertones of which it's almost impossible to detect within the film i could see it being considered if not winning during awards season frenetic but not bewildering touching but not sappy and direct without preaching 13_hours deserved a much better response that it's received.a must_see great movieeveryone who cares about our_government and how cowardly and politically correct it is should see this film.desde los inicios del cine existen las pel\\xc3\\xadculas con una ideolog\\xc3\\xada peligrosa aberrante que buscan hacer propaganda

hillary.better then you would think coming from michael_bay good action and visuals but some of the non combat segments are a little too on the nose does a decent job of not being overtly racist like i thought it would be although there was one shot i felt was completely unnecessary and inappropriate in the end it was still way to soon to make a movie about the subject matter.i never watch movies twice i did this one it captures the difficulty of contracted war the foolishness of government ignorance and the negligent lies of the state_department ie hillary_clinton without even mentioning a name.it was true_story american army try to kill a lot of people but also being killed by people.it was just bording.great film deserves the nz r16 rating full on action suspenseful confusing sometimes as to who the good and bad guys were but really well_done a true_story set in libya and rather sad towards the end but really glad i saw it it was quite a long film but it needed the length to portray the whole story and how the politicians sometimes let their military people down and also how sad the situation in libya really was when this happened.i absolutely loved the movie and the way he made it look how the soldiers described it i've also read the book and compared to the movie they are pretty identical yes he may have taken some stuff before the attck from a few chapters earlier but if he didn't the movie would have_been mabye 5 hrs long so i think when a filmmaker makes a movie like this we shouldn't criticize how the movie is made but read a book or look up what it's based_on online.amazing and eye_opening this story is about the heroic actions of a security_team defending a us compound but because it is just continuous action it lacks adequate depth and becomes boring the acting looks like it's done by rote and the story is long and texturally flat there is no character_development the soundtrack is good and the action well_done but it just seems to be all about people shooting at each_other the cinematography is done well overall this cliched confusing film doesn't do justice to what are clearly important historical events.decent modern history filmfast paced well_acted action thriller based_on an actual event kept_me on the edge of my_seat throughout excellent direction from michael_bay might have pulled more box office with a bruce willis in the cast but the lack of big name stars keeps the focus on the story well_done similar to argo but with more guns going off.i know i don't like michael_bay but he did goodjim halpert goes to extreme new horizons to get new clients for dunder mifflin.interesting pov on the benghazi incident shame more people won't recall who the potus sec of state was when all this went down and sadly the producers didn't have the balls to mention their un involvement during the incident.this is based_on real events a more accurate description is this movie is a pr orientated retelling of events what was allowed to happen in benghazi was despicable this movie presents the version of events that you are supposed to remember not wat happened it does not go into why the situation occoured but paints a very simple minded righteous good guy vs 1 dimensional evil bad guy mentality michael_bays directing style as always is akin to a guitarists solo that gets out of hand and goes for far too_long whilst the rest of the band onlooks in dismay the guitarist gets lost playing to himself for pure self gratification rather than playing his guitar to appeal to an inteligent audience.i enjoyed the last hour of the movie lots of action you already_know what it's about the last hour had the americans who were severely outnumbered defending the cia outpost in hostile territory.enjoyed the scene where they are training and yelling like beasts and the director is trying to work in his office.one of the best military black ops films ever seen.everytime i go to michael_bay movies i say maybe he changed.he never does he never will it's non_stop michael_bay porn from the start to the endif you were angry about how benghazi was handled you'll leave the theater with a fresh wave of disgust over the resounding ineptitude of our nation's leaders people risk their_lives to rescue an animal that has fallen through ice yet our leaders watched from a drone's live feed as our cia and embassy were attacked then we were told the next day it was a mob protesting a youtube video that got out of hand they lied people died what difference does it make this was almost a pretty decent movie it was cool to see john_krasinski prove that his wife emily blunt isn't the only one with action movie chops he definitely didn't look like the lanky funny guy from the office in this in fact all of his soldier buddies were enjoyable too and their on screen camaraderie was good fun throughout that wasn't enough to get past this being a bland and generic war movie though there were some really cheesy lines which definitely weren't meant to be funny but almost were through their badness i'm pretty sure also that no one ever told david_costabile that he wasn't just playing dan hardman in an episode of suits.one of the best war movies of all time this film tells the story of 6 brave_men who fought for their_lives and saved many other americans in the most_dangerous place in the world benghazi_libya this film makes you feel like you're right there next to them and what they went through on september_11 2012 i could watch this movie over and over and can't wait for it to come out on blu ray.michael bay need i say more very well_done true to the book actors did a great job with such a complex event saw this twice i got to be honest i love michael_bay movies keeping aside the infamously run down transformers series which i still love by the way his list of independent films such the rock armageddon pearl_harbor bad_boys 1 2 the island unfairly rejected and pain_gain are perfect examples of the hollywood blockbusters director michael_bay is known for his high impact action films that burst at the seams with unbridled patriotism each paint a picture of sheer superiority for the red white and blue in its devoted battle against in surmountable odds for the good of mankind and this one is no different bay's flirtation with a serious event takes time to build but when the temperature rises so does the death count as bullets fly and explosions deal out maximum destruction this film has all the hallmarks of a sensational night out at the cinema and knowing of its impending release i was unashamedly excited when the opening scenes flashed up onto the screen it's no masterpiece by any means and suffers from poor pacing and an occasional lack of depth but all in all with a ton of thrilling action_sequences throughout this is the sort of film that bay should be making because really is an entertaining and impressive watch most war movies depict battles that take place over weeks months or years the amount of action that occurred during this event all happened over about 13_hours and that is why it is such a great story it depicts the american heroes at their best who gave their_lives to save others against the orders of the higher management a war film depicting true events at_least somewhat of the 2012 terrorist_attacks on the american diplomatic_compound in benghazi_libya the story follows a six man security_team comprising of jack da silva john_krasinski tyrone rone woods james_badge dale kris tanto paronto pablo_schreiber dave boon benton david_denman john tig tiegen dominic fumusa mark oz geist max_martini stationed in a secret cia_base run by chief bob david_costabile when an american ambassador matt letscher is attacked in his u.s compound by an army of local militants its upto the six hired soldiers who must defend the remaining personal under their protection all hell breaks lose as the audience is witness to total warfare in an intense battle that lasts through the night chaos and very violent bloodshed ensued the movie never asks those questions raised by the news pundit about any whys and whats instead the event is presented solely from the perspective of the security detail and the team's desperate attempts to make sense of the situation at hand and in that we get the opportunity to really cheer them on as they just go forth and do what they think is right disregarding the political situation and their_own preoccupations these soldiers are shown as brave and talented and their decision to go out and save lives is a great moment in this film but what the film is really about is the chaotic events that transpired on the night of september_11 as such this is a hugely action_packed war film but what's best is that it succeeds in creating genuine tension fear and excitement on a regular basis although the film does take a little too_long to kick off the first burst of action is exhilarating bay's direction and overuse of shaky_cam is at_times frustrating but in general once this film moves into its middle portion all about the battle in benghazi and the desperate attempts of these soldiers to stay alive is hugely exciting from then on we get over an hour of non_stop action that is both entertaining as well as tense there are moments where the battle dies down but the film keeps moving through its use of suspense shown by the confusion of soldiers the film is very much in the mold of another high impact battle film black_hawk down and it is ridley scott's war epic that is referenced in bay's movie whereas black_hawk down was able to provide the audience with a repenting emotional edge this film although just as sombre just as disastrous does at_times fail to connect with its targeted audience this is not to say that michael_bay's little foray into the world of the modern soldier is not compelling watching the whole production is extremely well made and it immediately puts the viewer right into the highly intense atmosphere of north africa i enjoyed the different perspectives of command that we see through rone and bob and it's obvious that the movie shows us that rone is the better leader but this kind of takes us into the territory of how one sided this narrative is i mean we see the narrative from multiple perspectives but the cia is depicted as surprisingly ignorant to the situation they find themselves in now i don't_know much about the history of this actual event but it surprises me that the cia wouldn't have_been able to figure this out a little sooner who knows maybe this story is actually incredibly accurate but it does seem a little lopsided in favor of the security_team however this film isn't a total glorification of war and patriotism it does have the whole no man left behind mentality and it takes a lot of inspiration from black_hawk down itself but the grit and particularly in the final act the violence do present some interesting and intelligent questions regarding the entire middle_east situation none of the flaws are severe mostly they are limited to the expected over cutting of the material the occasional stylistic flourishes that don't quite gel with the rest of the movie e.g the mortar shell point of view some scenes that are explained rather than shown and a handful of line readings of the wisecracking dialogue that don't seem as natural as those that are in the rest of the movie the cast for this film aren't exactly big names or anything like that but they all do an excellent job regardless this might sound a little strange but i prefer lesser known actors for these types of movies it feels like the story can be a little less biased since it doesn't have to constantly follow the highest paid actor or actress the closest thing to a main_character this film has is the character of jack_silva played by john krasinksi better known as jim from the hilarious comedy series the office silva is a skilled ex soldier that goes to libya for the money but ends up regretting his decision because of how much he misses his family krasinski does the character justice by showing us the no nonsense attitude without going to far into corny bad ass soldier that's one thing i have to give the film credit for everyone comes off genuine rather than unbeatable rambos i also really enjoyed the interactions between rone played by james_badge dale and david costabile's character bob they both want the best for the people they're trying to protect but they go about it in completely different ways rone is more straightforward and quick to come to a decision while bob is more contemplative but slow to adapt to changing circumstances david_denman another the office alumni does a fine job on the whole 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is an intense powerful movie that brings out the best of michael_bay it is a film that not only sparkles with a strong direction realistic depiction of the horrors of war but also pays a well tribute to the soldiers out there who are sacrificing their_lives to defend the freedom of our_country 13_hours might not be up to the 2014 standards of american_sniper or black_hawk down but sets itself up to be a relative.it was like the same gunfight for 2 and a half hours far right propaganda movie 13_hours delivers justice to a story that needed to be told with great respect even if it does have it's share of michael bayisms.as a news junky i thought i knew what_happened that night but was surprised by some of the things that occurred also it was cool to see the actors that played tonto oz and tig and the actions they took.amazing sad movie surprisingly good90 this is one of the best michael_bay films a really good war film.of all the war films i've watched i feel like this when was fairly non political while also very up to date i enjoyed the film i thought it did a good job of accurately portrayed what_happened in benghazi.takes you inside and makes you feel there.did see hard to watch but according to those actually there it was spot on.great film no politics f u hillaryexcellent action scenes and cheesy melodrama in between i liked how the film makers attempted to make the battle scenes slightly disorienting in order to amp up the realism it took a few minutes in to get used to it but the overall effect was refreshing.not a huge war movie fan but this was an amazing movie.great movie was very surprisedthe liberal critics may hate this movie but i very much enjoyed it.an inside look into the personality behind the slaughter that was benghazi lots of firefights and even a few laughs.muss sich keinesfalls vor seinen genre konkurrenten verstecken this is michael_bay's best film since bad_boys ii.never one to subscribe to conspiracy theories but wtf why is there not even a terrible shaky_cam korean hard subtitled russian language version of this available anywhere never seen this before i really dont why its so low it was really good.michael bay you da manso done with critics they bash great movies michael_bay surprised me.only when the gunfight starts then the movie starts to get exciting but they just kept delaying it too_long before next action sequence happened againthough you see the news on tv it is so sad to watch what they actually went through our soldiers should have the respect of the american people our_government should respect them as well all should see this movie before they vote stop the same old same old.one of the best military movies_i've ever_seen great movie the directing and acting was exceptional it shows you how screwed up the government really is.intense and chilling given that this is based_on the true_story of what went wrong in benghazi that led to the death of the american ambassador 13_hours is everything an action_packed thriller would be periods of explosions and shootouts marked with intermittent quiet that prepares for the next onslaught the fear is real and much of the story hinges on the quiet mercenary heroes who go against the cia chief.god forbid that loser hippy film critics like a war movie that portrays our military for the heroes they are.as in the case of the church progs prefer to highlight the bad actions of the few therefore prejudicing fellow progs how ironic that our best put their_lives on the line to defend us from foreign enemies o ly to have progs then destroy the republic from within.a fantastic film that truly shows what it honestly looks like out there many gory images towards the end and a fair share of f words but other than that a definite show that is truly worth watchingmichael bay's_best movie of all time13 hours is an effective tribute to the story at hand and it's the best i've_seen from director michael_bay love those shots from the ground up it struggles a bit when it comes to things like the script narrative and pacing particularly a clich\\xc3\\xa9 humanizing section of the main cast but it's still an enjoyable tense flick with well_done action.i liked how they weren't too politically correct with the movie micheal_bay did a great job not going to political and i am flabbergasted that the movie was all true i know about benghazi but all of the stuff the only thing i don't like about it was how quick the battle was but i would rate it 4 3 4 stars but i'll say 513 hours le dernier film de michael_bay est un film de guerre remarquable qui une fois n'est pas coutume chez le r\\xc3\\xa9alisateur californien prend son temps pour poser son intrigue avant de laisser la fureur des explosions reprendre le flambeau non seulement bay parvient parfaitement \\xc3\\xa0 retranscrire l'atmosph\\xc3\\xa8re chaotique de la libye mais il livre des sc\\xc3\\xa8nes d'action aussi bonnes qu'\\xc3\\xa0 l'accoutum\\xc3\\xa9e le tout avec une col\\xc3\\xa8re non feinte envers l'administration am\\xc3\\xa9ricaine du moment ereintant mais pourtant jamais trop long 13_hours a aussi la chance d'avoir d'excellents acteurs dont john_krasinski toby stephens demetrius grosse dans ses rangs pour renforcer la force de cette histoire incroyable a ne pas louper.this movie is under rated its not as tense or gore or dramatic compared to other war movies but this movie tried to show the real raw reality and what i like most is how it potrayed the loss of the family of the bad gus as well.it was awesome and true not like any other michael_bay movie and it was true down to the bonemichael bay's fast_paced dramatisation about 2012 benghazi attack is not only tense and gripping but also overlong a little bit boring and sometimes melancholic and overdramatic.let's hope this doesn't turn out as bad as point break i doubt that already because it is showing good reviews already even_though michael_bay directed it this can be better_than pain gain.fuck you michael bay.the best movie about war that i've_seen so far in the movie americans in libya cia specifically were attacked by local people who didn't like their presence after some casualties the americans decided to withdraw all their personnels in the country and declared libya as a failed country.this true_story is full of action and things blowing up as michael_bay is known for best the political event battle looks bad on the shot callers of our_government hillary_clinton but good on our country's brave soldiers that did the best they could to save our citizens and agents in country that wanted to kill them the action was full throttle and a bit annoying at_times to watch shaky cameras and not being able to tell what was happening in the frame a la transformers but the story was interesting although some of the characters came off a little flat rating 7.5 10while the buildup in the first third takes a while and the non combat character building scenes can veer on the melodramatically dull side the firefight scenes and the scenes that go with it control rooms charts etc are extremely well_done and it maintains tension throughout it also veers away from any politics in favor of just telling the story of the boots on the ground and proves that michael_bay can be a solid filmmaker when he's allowed to.michael bay's_best film in a whilejust another violent moviegreat movie terrible government response 13_hours is a story of courage through an intense and dangerous night but one must take off their blue or red colored glasses to appreciate the message the movie is based_on an actual event that took_place in libya in the year 2012 at first i thought the movie was politically motivated due to the content and timing of the release however after watching 13_hours i felt differently about it the focus of the movie was behind the 6_men who were in benghazi to defend the americans living there at the time on assignment there was no mention of major political figures involving this controversial event during the movie with the focus on these 6_men i think the movie did a great job giving the audience a feeling of what that night was like in benghazi to feel surrounded by people who want to kill you and not knowing when or if help was even coming must have_been a very horrific situation 13_hours gave the audience a glimpse into the fear and also the courage it took to protect the americans who were in benghazi at that time throughout the movie we are given glimpses into the personal lives of these_men to add an emotional connection the acting was well_done especially by john_krasinski who portrayed the main_character of the movie the movie portrays some very violent scenes as well that can be hard to see and the sound effects make you feel like you're right there in benghazi the director michael_bay accomplishes his goal of creating a very heroic movie that will keep you on the edge of your_seat with the intensity of the event if you are planning on seeing this movie put political agendas aside and allow yourself to have a small glimpse of what these people experienced that night in benghazi without a red or blue view you may just gain some sympathy for the americans who survived the attack and the 4 who lost their lives.awesome thought_provoking 13_hours is an intense well made film about six men who were truly heroic in one messed up situation hard to believe our_government would allow americans to endure such a thing without the slightest bit of help while bay avoids most of the politics just enough ooze through to stir emotion in those that understand we live in troubling times easily michael_bay's best film bravo sir.the first_half of the movie is just rough and slow pased throughout the movie it started to get better with great suspense and action another problem is that micheal_bay still does shaky_cam which does get annoying and ruins the vibe this is based off a true_story so it is very sad which does a great job if doing the ending finished the movie off strong which i wont spoil.exceptionally good heart rending excitement want to see again.hillary and obama should be in jaillike a tighter wiser and more taut black_hawk down this is a surprisingly apolitical feature from michael_bay it's no masterpiece but it's entertainment peppered with minor philosophy.politics aside michael_bay did a great job of these brave_men risking their_lives while confirmed reports based around that part of the world were waiting for the authorization to move one of the characters said it best when she asked for a fly by just to spook the attackers people that bash bay seem to have an agenda but overall he told this story and did a great job.very great action and storyline in it it even was accurate like the book as well the best michael_bay film i've watched so far this movie was excellent a must_see for all americans.quite possibly one of the best films i have seen on par with american_sniper very realistic and emotional.the first_half of the movie is just rough and slow pased throughout the movie it started to get better with great suspense and action another problem is that micheal_bay still does shaky_cam which does get annoying and ruins the vibe this is based off a true_story so it is very sad which does a great job if doing the ending finished the movie off strong which i wont spoil.good action not so story line.a non_stop barrage of the senses this movie at_least tries to ascertain what_happened that fateful 2nd 9_11 attack on america bay is a great action director and since there is not much thoughtfulness in this movie as written he certainly keeps you on the edge of your_seat and i was completely engrossed in what was happening to these brave americans except for the cia station chief who comes off looking like he has balls of putty i was thoroughly entertained.is this a good movie no has your typical bayisms but is it entertaining as hell yesmichael bay blaast veel op in dit waargebeurde oorlogsverhaal inclusief de geloofwaardigheid van de gebeurtenis waardoor 13_hours voornamelijk overkomt als een typische schietgrage actie film die gewend zijn van bay zijn eerdere werken makkelijk verteerbaar maar ook niet veel meer dan dat this movie based_on real_life events shows how skankles clinton should be tried for treason skankles does not care about anyone or thing but her own self interest she lied and tired to use the abandon people under her command as fodder for her career the movie is gripping and holds your attention it shows just how fanatical the muslims are if not there it will be here.an amazing breakdown of what_happened at benghazi.great movie from michael_bay truly immersive keeps you on the edge of your_seat from beginning to endhonestly i couldn't care less what's happening actually.one of the best movies i have seen in a long long time 5_stars its pathetic when people bring their politics into a movie review when the movie was made to honor those that fought and died and tell the story of people that were actually there it was a good movie.not a perfect movie a bit too_long a bit too may f bombs but war is hell f'ing hell how is hillary not in jail all the gods all the heavens all the hells are within you hahaha all the liberal kooks hate the movie i love it.tipica pelicula gringa exaltando la magnificencia y honor de sus soldados en el campo de batalla con todo el cumulo emocional incluido que representan sus bajas en territorio extranjero y sus hazan'as aniquilando personas fuera de sus fronteras disculpen hablando cinematograficamente se ve claramente la mano de michael_bay las escenas de combaten muy reales tanto como los modernos juegos de rpg si eres de los que gusta de la accion combate guerra moderna ignorando toda politica te va a entretener michael_bay does a decent job on making a realistic film even_though his storytelling could've been improved c brought a tear my eye in a good way harrowing intense powerful unrelenting violent 91 out of 100 riveting account of our finest soldiers 13_hours is a film that seems happy to drown itself in the alright category it suffices to say that the set_pieces are superbly executed the turn off factors arrive in the form of relentless rambling and cardboard characters nevertheless this michael_bay flick is engrossing unlike his recent transformers sequels 13_hours is mostly targeted at the pumped up american youth and never aspires to be the hurt_locker or zero_dark thirty or even lone_survivor most people won't watch this because they don't want to know the truth great movie though.this movie is intense and extremely realistic hopefully our service members have a lot more political support than this.excellent film and possibly the best action soldier merc film since black_hawk down my_favourite michael_bay does a great job with the visuals and the tension is excellent even at the end you're still not sure good film to own.based upon a true_story although with a few hollywood style changes to make it more dramatic in places i enjoyed this it was gritty interesting and not entirely full of explosions as in most other michael_bay movies dare i say this but one f his better films.one of the best movies_i've seen in a long time this is worthy of an oscar most definitely the best movie this year.in september of 2012 just weeks before the presidential election it was more important to hillary_clinton and the obama administration to get obama reelected than it was to be truthful with the american people about what_happened in benghazi so hillary and obama spread a massive lie about the benghazi attack being motivated by a cartoon they didn't want the obama admin to look week right before the election and risk his losing they canvassed all the more than willing media outlets all weekend with their lie.this movie doesn't make a political statement but simply recounts the attack that killed ambassador christopher stevens and members of our cia you should watch.un tr\\xc3\\xa8s bon effort de michael_bay qui change un peu des super productions \\xc3\\xa0 coup de gros effets sp\\xc3\\xa9ciaux la r\\xc3\\xa9alisation demeure quand m\\xc3\\xaame plut\\xc3\\xb4t efficace bay auras eu au moin une bonne excuse de mettre quelque explosions dans son film probably michael_bay's best movie.exceeded my expectations by a trillion.we all know mr bay movies are loud and entertaining this one is load because it has to be not only for the real_life heroes involved but also for the political agenda it states but also avoids it a micheal_bay movie with heart the accuracy of the story through the eyes and lost of the soldiers whom defended a compound they didn't need to that made a stand when everyone else was just watching i enjoyed the movie for the story it told but it also made me realize how messed up this world is and the duty we all have but choose not to do our bit i recommend this movie both thumbs are upjust watched this on dvd awesome film really impactful and eye_opening knowing the film was fairly really accurate from what the real soldiers said in the cnn interview definitely recommend watching for sure 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi follows the true_story of a group of former soldiers who put their_lives on the line to defend remaining american diplomats in libya from an attack by islamic militants in 2012 the film is directed by everyones favourite michael_bay and stars john_krasinski in a very dramatic role far from the comedic characters we are used to seeing him portray now i have seen quite a few of these war dramas that tend to touch on the themes of loss pain and ptsd associated with war and some seem to be more successful than others at really conveying these themes in a way that engages you in the story this one though didn't really do that well there were some personal emotional scenes that were effective and also some standoffs that got a little intense but overall it felt like one of the more average war dramas of recent years touching on all the elements that it should focus on but not really excelling at any of them.one thing i think the film accomplished reasonably well was highlighting some of the more personal conflicts and thoughts that the soldiers would be going through during the events of the film they did a somewhat effective job at setting up these characters so that you are ready to really care for these_guys and be on the edge of your_seat when they begin to face danger but those moments never come during the last 40_minutes of the movie the film tries to bring out those feelings but it never comes through and thats where i have to talk about the fact that the conflicts in this film although they were shot well and were the more engaging scenes in the movie it lacked any real weight to the situation yes i get the fact that the 6_men are vastly outnumbered but the film did a terrible job at illustrating the fact that they were in any real danger and so i was simply admiring the beauty of the scenes and not really biting my nails in fear of what may happen and just so you know it was a much more subdued version of the action you are used to seeing in michael_bay's transformers films a lot more easier to follow and wasn't full of random unexplained explosions showing that when his hands are tied by facts of an event he can really do action well.but this film is definitely not free from the michael_bay issues a lot of his other films suffer from the main one being that this movie is just so painstakingly long like seriously this did not have to be anywhere near 144 minutes it just meant that between the various gun fights the movie was filled with a lot of nothing you actually feel at_times that you have_been watching this movie for 4 hours when really it has only been 1 and a half for a film where the pacing all the way through is really slow a lot of the filler needed to be cut down to avoid long 20_minutes patches of nothing of interest at all and that severely hurt my enjoyment of the film cut the film down to 105 minutes an you could have hit all the same points without boring a majority of viewers but thats how bay does his films so i guess theres no changing that the slo mo also makes a comeback and although it is minor it still doesn't work and is oddly placed.as i mentioned earlier the last 40_minutes of the film is where the film tries to accumulate all the character setup and emotional weight into one sequence but it wasn't effective in doing that but if you are able to stick with the film until this point it does finish on a slightly positive note by giving you something that you can still enjoy just due to the nature of the scene and context of what is going on but in the end if you are a fan of michaels bays movies you will get a lot more out of this film than most other people it just looks like his best days are behind him 5 10michael bay should stop making turtle movies and just stick to these type of action flicks this is what he's known for and this doesn't disappoint except for the last part though.must say this michael_bay movie has exceeded my expectation john_krasinski is exceptionally good as the leading role and the action is so very well made that it kept you on the edge of the seat loved it michael_bay brought you into the story jim from the office acting skill is emerging i believe j.k is really for more serious role kodu i am surprised to see that this movie did not get rated higher then 51 this movie kept_me on the edge of my_seat the entire time.good movie action is realistic and intense good story good performances.good pace awesome visuals 10 10 sound hearing the bullet casings fall around you or feeling a hard thud of bass through your body from a mortar strikes never gets old this has to be watched on bluray and loud if you have a sound system that can handle ita very mixed movie the military scenes were interesting and well_done for what i imagine things might be like but the rest of the movie was much weaker and at_times just bad the writers have a very clear and self serving point of view contractors who work for the cia good strong capable brave etc while cia staff idiots baffoons incompetent etc it was interesting to understand the general contour of the events of benghazi even if i take a lot of the specifics with a grain of salt given how blatant the point of view was in the movie overall 2.5 stars.great movie michael_bays best workshould have_been so much better thats what happens when michael_bay is the director sadexcellent movie good story my respect the fallen and actors to live this story michel bay congratulations for your productioni watched this 7 times in three days so i guess i like the moviethis movie is fuckin intense a movie that i liked from bay what the hell outstanding one of the best movies_i've ever_seen i'm no war movie buff and i don't like michael_bay films so when i read the professional film critic_reviews i in my naivet\\xc3\\xa9 believed them and didn't go see the movie in theaters.i thought it would be too over the top with gratuitous violence and all the other accusations made against the film.i bought it when it came out on amazon and have watched in 5 times in 5 days it is without question one of the most deeply moving films i have ever_seen not one word of the criticisms leveled against this extraordinary movie is true the acting is compelling the script is engaging the drama is gripping and the action is realistic and only features enough to help the viewer experience what those 6_men went through.the movie is completely apolitical it is the critics with a clear left wing agenda who politicized this story of bravery and mind boggling courage under fire.highly highly_recommend this movie in fact i created this rotten tomatoes account for the express purpose of being one voice to set the record straight that this movie has a 51 rating is a national disgrace and an affront to the men whose lives are so beautifully depicted 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a movie with staying power it's no doubt destined to be remembered as one of the modern_warfare classics for its impressive technical merits but more importantly reproduction of a proud but at the same time damning moment in modern history the film shies away from overt political commentary but there's no mistaking its stance above all of that however it's an honest tribute to those who lived and died the film deserves to be remembered in the same breath as the similarly constructed and themed black_hawk down.sounds like the critics cant handle the message truth the movie was amazingthis fact based movie based_on a book that is based_on the facts from those on the ground is one of the best i have seen in a while i read the reviews from the leftist socialist hillary loving scumbags of course they are going to put the movie down it tells the truth about the criminal hillary and all she intentionally did not do to save those americans that lost their_lives but she had to make sure her political career would not be tarnished by a few americans losing their_lives hillary is such a piece of s t and one can only hope that some patriotic american does whatever is necessary to make sure that criminal does not become president to all you socialist scumbags out there i can't wait for the inevitable civil war that is coming you morons are so out gunned.action packed none of them should have_been there.the disgusting truthdon't get the hate michael_bay has done right he has shown what had happened the reality and the inside jokes that surrounded the film was perfect shows why hillary_clinton must not become president.excellent film si vous avez aim\\xc3\\xa9 la chute du faucon noir ce film est pour vous.should be sleep but instead i been up watching this so 13_hours is also the running_time for this movie well_done michael bay.fantastic the professional critics no doubt have problems with this film that have nothing to do with the quality or value of the movie.if you're hungry for a slice of all american beefcake this is the film for you sure it's no masterpiece but 13_hours is two and a half hours of relentlessly tense action_sequences joined by well_acted and convincing political scenarios invariably entertaining and packed with likable characters 13_hours is simply a solid film.lots of action my kind of chill moviemichael bay is one of the worst big name directors in hollywood but 13_hours may be his best film to date it is a heavily flawed movie but what it lacks in things like character_development and style it has a huge thing going for it it's entertaining michael_bay will always do the boneheaded decision making he always does so when he makes a pretty good film like this we should just be grateful.if you liked hurt_locker you would like this one too.awesome movie lot of actionthis movie is worth every dime it's a must watch action_packed true_story about how our_government left its citizens die in vainplenty of action not much of a storylineamazing moviethis is the last straw for me ur ratings are wothless to meyou know it's a good film when you cry at the endamazing movie critics got this very wrongvery well_done intense yet thoughtful portrayal of that lonely day i'll take it with a hollywood glitzy grain of salt but thought that bay successfully walked a fine line between blatantly calling out the white house for lying out about the events that day while abandoning american citizens no names were named but very effective fingers were pointed you get the idea yet he focuses the story on these_men on this day great cast but perhaps the surprise gem was the operator portrayed by porn stache from orange is the new black.this is a fantastic movie all these people on here are just trying to pretend it doesn't meet some make believe expectation it shows the bonds of brothers the emotional stress between families courage love passion and that after all these_men had done for their country their country had abandoned them fantastic movie executed exceptionally well.exceptional movie michael_bays best in a long time.great movie carefully directed and heart wrenching to know something like this really occurred.it's the second occasion first was pain_gain for a very long time that bay actually proves he can direct weighty dramas as well 13_hours is an accurate thrilling and heroic movie about people who do for living what they think is right 13_hours is about different aspects how people can see the world 13_hours is not flawless in the genre it can't show actual new and fresh viewpoints but everything it enumerates is great 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a throughly entertaining film from michael_bay i was genuinely surprised the performances are all top_notch john_krasinski and james_badge dale lead the great performances of the soldiers in the film none of the other characters get that much development though the action is very dramatic it isn't cheesy like pearl_harbor it is very gritty and realistic the script isn't great but it is a michael_bay film so yeah you can tell easily that this was a michael_bay film but it is much more dramatic and entertaining my only other complaint is that it is way too_long overall i was shocked with the quality of this film it isn't perfect but it is very entertaining.hillary clinton should be in prison.michael bay hasn't made the worst movie of all time but what he has made with 13_hours is a 2 and 1 2 hour long trailer for an underachieving politically mute espionage war pic.i know the historical accuracy is questioning but it's a good film a black_hawk down type movie really liked krasinski and schreiber as usual bay does a good job with blowing stuff up worth the watch.i mean wow how could you go wrong with a war movie huh i mean the acting was great cast was great what can possibly make this movie a 3 star well idk let's see a plot that has been done many many times before and while this i guess you can say hey its what happens everyday fine but as entertainment i want new exciting fun gripping not the same over and over conflict that we get from the news everyday13 hours is based_on a true_story that happened in 2012 in benghazi it is full of intense action and combat fighting scenes a good watch 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is tense trilling and a really good war drama from director michael_bay help by solid cast performances the movie maybe have his low points like a long runtime but still manage to deliver a solid thriller based in a true_story 4 5 liked it more than i expected to watch if you're a fan of movies like american_sniper or lone survivor.such a chilling movie.war movies are one of my 2 favorite genres and this movie does it proud.people are so critical of the littlest things and forget to see the big picture that this film is based off a true event and that only those involved could truly depict everything that happened those men are true hero's.definitely my_favorite michael_bay movie the action scenes were okay from here and there great performances by some of the actors but it lacked the thrill if the director is going to give a scene a good thrill he she should make sure the audience care for the characters first before he puts them in danger the ending affected me in an emotional way and to me the ending did stood out the most since we actually did care for the characters in the middle part of the film good film overall action junkies will enjoy this 13_hours was way too_long for it's own good and at_times felt like a loud action film than a drama there were times where it was melodramatic and there were times where it goes too far across michael_bay land overall i believe bay made a good movie that should be watched it feels real for the most part and the performances make it even better.great movie great story solid performances definitely worth a purchaseit has been years since we have seen a good michael_bay movie but now we have finally got something that can be put on the same pedestal as the rock and bad_boys bay does such a good job with the source material that he has and creates something incredibly memorable which is something that i never thought i was ever going to say about bay there are some great performances from james_badge dale and john_krasinski who throws away that funny guy persona and becomes one of the coolest badasses in modern film my only negatives are the fact that there are never any motivations given to the terrorists and that makes them expendable characters the worst kind of characters in movies i don't like the fact that they never mention the politics involved because this situation had a big impact on the politics in america moving forward however in the end i really liked this movie and i hope that bay will begin to do some more of these films.this is michael_bay's best film in his entire career he actually treats this event with respect the action_sequences are perfect and surprisingly there is actual character_development not so much mindless action movie as we would have expected here impressive bay most impressive athis movie creates a question and then answers ten fold it hits the spot in almost every area having been deployed several times myself i can attest to the films realistic point of view the worst part of a firefight are the long stretches of boring in between waiting and contemplating your next action just as well as theirs.this is the true_story of what_happened in benghazi and how hillary_clinton and barrack obama refused to send our men help you will notice that the critic's only gave the movie 51 but 86 of the audience liked it truth hurts sometimes huh the movie left me with a very tight jaw the administration may have lied to the public about the video but they failed to handle this situation in a professional manner if it weren't for the actions of the security_team we would have seen many more dead americans the critics may not love the film but i don't go to watch critics.emotional and true_story that made me feel proud to be an american citizena great movie with a fantastic cast covering the 13_hours of hell several americans had to endure because corrupt politician and failed secretary of state hillary_clinton refused to send them help a great reminder that politicians and bureaucrats should care about america before their_own bank accounts if they are to be fit for office.it was a great movie and you see what obama and hillary did they just as soon have pulled the trigger themselves.better than i thought either hillary is lying or the guy's who were there are telling the truth sad knowing the government could have done more to help the people.not the usual film michael_bay likes to make but he gives it his best shot and it's very good full of great action and very good performances by all the cast that is more emotional than you think maybe it didn't need as many jokes as it had as the story is based_on real events and what the story was about should of been told more serious it deserved more praise from critics but they don't seem to give michael_bay a chance now days it's sick to think that their_own country left them with very little support and i'm glad this story got told as it proves not all fact based us army stories make them out to be the knights in shining armour if you enjoyed american_sniper and the lone_survivor this film will be right up your street.some good shizz a bit like black_hawk down but not as over the toppretty good movie with a lot of action.great action great story 1st off i'm not a huge fan of michael_bay's directing he has some shots in his movies i don't care for slow_motion moments he allows scenes to have weird lighting like this movie but can't deny he puts together amazing action scenes i'm not too crazy about his films except armageddon pearl_harbor this one was a wonderful surprise to come out of him i love war movies love true war movies this was great i think he honored the real men nicely it wasn't perfect got a little slow with a movie called 13_hours you can expect it to be on the longer side but i really enjoyed it mostly for the cast great group of men they got i am a huge fan of john_krasinski thought he was amazing in this everyone was absolutely amazing also found it very intense it also wasn't over the top action explosions it all worked one of michael_bay's better films i'm very glad i own this 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is one of the best movies_i've ever_seen it's an action_packed roller coaster that is going to keep you on the edge of your sit definitely a must_see \\xc3\\xb0 \\xc3\\xb0 \\xc3\\xb0 excellent edge of your_seat movie.pretty bad ass movie kinda like black_hawk down meets american_sniper the explosions were pretty michael_bay esque i.e big and exaggerated some of the battle scenes looked a bit too call of duty esque but overall a very entertaining film.a solid war film bolstered by exhilarating action really though makes me want to play black ops as a veteran this movie is pretty accurate all the proper jargon movements mannerisms and of course military humor this film gets it if your a civilian this movie might will upset you downtime is the worse don't overthink this film just know your military hard chargers are a different breed and proud while secretly serving their country they do so so that you do not have to so when you hear all the gods all the heavens and all the hells are within you it means that hopefully our sacrifices are not in vain.super intense and emotional film.it's not epic but it was entertaining to watch the sad part in this film is that it's true_story i was surprised that michael_bay actually made a good movie john karsinski and james_badge dale were excellent i feel bad that this film did not get more recognition then it deserves we are so cocooned in the western world that we forget that this world can be so ugly only scene where i rolled my eyes is at the end american flag laying in a pool the american flag close up shots in movies is getting redundant and ridiculous.intense realistic can't fathom that our_government left them to die it was so real.if only the first_half was as good as the last but extremely better_than bay's last attempt at the genre with pearl_harbor why did it take so long to release this great movie to the public \\xc3\\xb0 a must_see the government failed its own sad to watch and hear the story from this point of view thank you to the few that sacrificed.from beginning to end great movie an action movie it has it's flaws but the performances the scenery and awesome and unrealistic army action_sequences make this a really enjoyable one.not once in this movie was hillary_clinton mentioned along with what potus and the secretary of state was doing people call this a political film this does not align with any political party the person they put the blame on was the chief at the annex who stalled the contractors for half an hour.the action is superb and the true_story of these soldiers is poignantmichael bay's_best film in a long time although the film probably didn't need almost 150 minutes to tell it's story the intense visuals and gripping performances won't leave you bored 13_hours is an amazing story about 6_men that defended a secret u.s base in benghazi in an attempt to save american lives the actors make you emotionally connect with their characters and every action scene carries weight the combat sequences are shot beautifully and there is a decent amount of gore in conclusion 13_hours is a very well_done war story that truly makes you feel thankful for the soldiers that protect you every day if only michael_bay would direct more movies like this instead or transformers and pearl harbor.a startling and emotional look at our government's failure to protect it's own on foreign soil brutal real and harrowing let us never forget those who died for us.unfreakingbelievable bs if michael_bay wants to make a serious movie about a serious topic especially when it relate to military subjects he should at_least get teach john_krasinski how to hold a rife this movie represents the pure american self righteousness and double standard.unfortunately this is a true heartbreaking nightmare of a story that maybe could have_been prevented or the burden could have at_least been lessoned i'm seriously on the verge of tears absolutely unbelievable hillary you r responsible for those 4 deaths u and obamait drag a lot good action_sequences tough.surprisingly toned_down turn for bay a bit long as usual with him but the story is handled well with a decent air of authenticity.one of the best movies i have seen in a long time and especially since it is a true_story very inspiring and emotional.this movie exceeded our expectations great surprise and great movie.watching the movie i kept my hands over my eyes not believing hoping things would change it's like the titanic you know the ending but you watch anyway it was so sad the movie is so realistic that i had a nightmare about it it is amazing as a movie the acting spectacular but it is so very sad.michael bey tried to make this a political movie hie efforts failed.the six guys in this movie are absolute heros what they went through with no support from our_government to save and protect the people at this covert operation should be widely celebrated instead of covered up god_bless these_men and their patriotism.a truly emotional thrill ride 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi finds michael_bay making an equal balance of explosions and character i know right a michael_bay movie with extensive character driven sequences and knockout performances from james_badge dale and pablo schreiber.after a string of action films of debatable success michael_bay bringsus yet another fast_paced action film full of the usual u.s propagandaand militaristic rhetoric.theme wise and just as an action film sure this movie has yourtypical action_packed sequence of events explosions violence blood and death by the dozens from beginning to end maybe that's enough forthe majority of viewers to feel like they're watching somethingworthwhile and if that's all you want then by all means enjoy thisramboesque montage of death and destruction it certainly gets youpumped up and dramatizes the camaraderie between the soldiers thatform the core group in this movie their military hardware wide arrayof weaponry and well honed physiques certainly intensifies thatfeeling of power and superiority making the life of a mercenary seemlike a glorious way to make a living and friendship it is certainlyfull of great action with a cast that plays well off each_other 3 ofthe actors were all in the office 2005 2013 so they had plenty ofexperience there is a nice consistent tension throughout the film and the film focuses on the danger that the u.s citizens are in bykeeping a fast pace with loads of violence once you get past all that superficial nonsense the movie is prettygod awful at_times it's tries to portray itself as a hero film similar to that of black_hawk down 2001 and even goes so far as tomention that film as the current situation that they are in but thismovie is certainly is doing its best to copy the situation americanpersonal trapped behind enemy lines with overwhelming numbers againstthem it's a huge carbon copy just without the helicopters and asmaller central cast i mean kudos to the screenwriter who points outthe similarity between the film and was cheeky enough to put that inthe dialogue but if you're going to copy a film perhaps is best notto mention it only because black_hawk was a much better film in somany ways likewise the movie is heralded as a true_story from the beginning.however several eye witness accounts have mentioned that this movie isfar off the mark from what really happened in the course of the 13 hoursiege on the cia_base in libya so much so that the cia operative whowas in charge of the base at the time issued a press release shortlyafter the film's premiere criticizing the film as a distortion ofevents the situation stems from the military contractors adamantlysaying they received stand down orders when no such orders were given.the dramatization of events isn't anything new in film but if you'regoing to take a whole lot of leeway with true events then you can'treally call it a true_story anymore of course it all depends on whoyou believe but if the movie and book aren't based_on the facts theyare therefore untrue however the movie isn't a lesson on failedpolicies or truth it's an action flick so it's up to the viewer tomake up their_own mind about what_happened that day if you want tocreate a pumped up action film then stick to that and don't call it atrue story i don't feel that this distortion of events pays tribute to the life ofu.s senator john christopher stevens in a way that honors his sacrificefor his country overall it's a solid action film and michael_bay does his thing well.he really drives home the fact that despite what_happened that day america still kicks ass murica 2.5 5amazing movie shows the truth to what people like to cover up and ignore too many damn liberals on here thank you to our military and vets these 6_men were absolutly amazingamazing movie incredible story wonderfully shot but it's about an hour too_long and it tries a little too hard to make the audience feel a certain way.great movie really sad watch it people it's not perfect but people need to back off the bay shit and just watch a major event in our history the past 10 years.finally a micheal_bay movie that isn't complete trash someone like kathryn_bigelow could have done much better with the material but this is still appropriately tense with some well_done action scenes the writing was pretty poor throughout and it's not exactly subtle.one of my_favorite movies of 2016 so far intense really phenomenal movie on every level factual unbiased incredible cinematography and the acting was on point bonus is knowing brave americans are still protecting our freedom sad part is if not for obama and hillary these americans including our ambassador never needed to die good acting really good action hard to understand what was said during some scenes where was their help what does the us government say about this was very interesting thought the movie had good flow and wasn't to far fetched in the fight seens.this movie is terrible it was a bunch of bearded bad actors and tough guy one liners.as good as black_hawk down very good.i moving movie will make you angry and sad.this was a good movie even if it wasn't based_on a true_story but because it is it is that much better.very michael_bay on history here great action_sequences followed by little character_development still an enjoyable movie about a controversial topic would have liked a bit more of the political side but obviously this was not meant to be a purely political film.good entertainment definitely worth_watching hard to believe people will still vote for hillary when she allowed americans to die like that.this movie raises more questions than it answers hard to watch it and be ambivalent to the total lack of a timely and decisive response by our_government equally sad and infuriating.michael bay finally shows restraint by sticking to the facts with visceral action and strong performances.as much as i wanted to like this movie it lacked substance it was intense but lacked heart the last half_hour or so was the best part of the movie.this movie portrayed the events that occurred in libya with a sense of dignity and respect for the people who were there if you've ever wondered just what_happened to our embassy and the people staffing it take the time to watch this movie13 hours is michael_bay doing a film that he actually cares about and it's actually good it has minor bay isms with slow_motion explosions but also some heart the dramatic tension is what is missing that would make this movie great despite krasinski and others doing solid work.excellent movie ranks right up there in my_opinion with some of the best emotional and intense i loved every minute once you get past the superficial nature the usual us propaganda and militaristic rhetoric you're left with a solid meat potatoes micheal_bay action movie the movie vaguely sets up a political backdrop in an unstable libya but it plays out like a zombie movie where libyan insurgents are zombie getting mowed down cia contractors after wave after wave of attacks they get tired of getting slaughtered and movie is over verdict it's carbon copy of black_hawk down but when it's all said and done you don't_know what was the justification for the entire film merica good film but people who not familiar with what_happened the film really don't paint a clear a picture for those type of people my ol lady was loss the who filmit's hard to imagine a less appealing notion than michael_bay tackling the 2012 attack on a united_states embassy outpost and cia_base in benghazi_libya more than three years after the fact the incident has become both the flashpoint of america's disastrously half assed intervention in libya and the subject of so many farcical show trials that benghazi has become a meme for right wing paroxysm to be sure 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi certainly lives up to its sardonic nickname \\xc3\\xa2bayghazi \\xc3\\xa2 as it contains all the flashy but incomprehensible camera tricks bad jokes and the even worse self seriousness that categorizes bay's work though his typical distrust of government is mostly evinced here in the huffy impotence and curt officiousness of the cia station's feckless chief david_costabile the conflict between bay's respect for the men he profiles and his natural inclination toward simple minded clich\\xc3\\xa3 c results in early scenes that struggle for a level of focus that's almost necessitated by the film's added patina of topicality the opening for instance consists of tedious setup and bland exposition that remind the viewer that bay for all his fidgety cutting and slapdash composition is too often painstakingly dull no matter who writes his films characters are always introduced the way they are in dan brown novels as a summary of credentials in place of a personality.watchable rat a tat flick despite typical incoherent fast cut shaky action_sequences surprisingly incompetent libyan militants but supposedly a true_story so can't hold that against the film.i thought it was a good movie13 hours is a film by director michael_bay and is based_on true events for all the crappy movies that bay has put of the past few years this is one of him most mature and best films to date the film is just amazing and all around epic the film has a great script full of excellent characters even if some don't get as much screen time as they should performances were really good and helped to really drive in this emotional moments the film is action_packed full of great set_pieces and good cinematography altho there are a few bumps in the road here in there like michael_bays insistence on using immature humor altho it isn't near as atrocious as what we got in transformers as well as those explosions that look like fire works at_times etc it may be a bit shocking but this is a great film by michael_bay something we haven't_seen in years and its by far his best effort at telling a true_story and honoring the real events overall 4 1 2sad is how these people were abandoned by the politicians it's also sad to think the late ambassador stevens had made 600 plus requests to hillary_clinton for additional security all ignoredi really enjoyed this movie i love military movies the movie deviates from the facts a bit but is still awesome the charater tanto really takes the movie lol.i'm sure there is a lot of classified information not included in the story plot like that potus went to bed that night and it being election time how about the headache scandal how many high ranking officials knew americans were dying this is a great time for this movie to come out my heart goes out to all the victims and survivors of the benghazi attack.how completely accurate it is that is debatable but as an action pic it's pretty darn good.brilliant thoroughly enjoyed this movie.a lot more blackhawk_down and a lot less political than i expecteda really empty film with short role of peyman moaadi this is a jumbled mess that lives up to its name the movie feels like it takes 13_hours to watch.this movie shows that michael_bay can still turn it on when he is motivated most of his films are massive explosions with horrible stories but this may be his best film since bad_boys or the rock john_krasinski james_badge dale and pablo_schreiber all pull out great performances in this retelling of a horrible incident that took_place in bengazi i was locked in from the beginning until the credits roll.this movie certainly does its job it is very very chilling you certainly feel as if you are in their shoes fantastic film i feel as if michael_bay actually put effort into making this film to put it on the favourable side of critics it may have not worked with the critics but it worked with me it was sure damn close to being a surreal war movie and i give michael_bay admiration for trying to make a quality film.great action with a michael_bay that did not play the big drums all the time more like a finetuned orchestra full of power and finesseto make a good movie michael_bay need something other than explosion well a lot of things another movie to promote sort of america spirit or whatever yawnz.get this now for all americans to watch learn understand superbly done w no blaming just your own morales to wrap around this incredible film.well put together makes you appreciate the ease of our lives here in the states.michael bay nailed it possibly his best crafted film.wish it showed more about what was happening on the military end who got the calls who responded or didn't respond otherwise very compelling sometimes hard to follow still not sure who or what feb13 was code for friendly or what a story that deserved to be told.this is michael_bay's best movie since the first bad_boys and that really isn't hard to do given his track record the film leaves the politics aside for a action heavy pro american war film about a group of men in a sol situation bay does know how to stage and shoot action scenes but that is about it while there are some emotional moments at the end the rest of the film suffers from cheesy dialogue and characters that needed more depth still this is a solid war movie about some brave_men it isn't black_hawk down or the hurt_locker but in the hands of another director it could have_been grade bwhy is it when i see a movie that the critics give a splat to i love it and when i see one they praise its terrible liberal agenda i dont get it this movie was great.american heroes13 hours is unlike any film michael_bay it takes itself seriously actually invigorates patriotism and honors those who were involved in the event michael_bay has created his most inspired film since the rock michael_bay has been made fun of and scoffed at so much for his transformers films that he has become a very unappreciated talent in the film industry this film proves that he is someone with a great visual eye making majestic set_pieces like no other filmmaker can he gets great performances from his actor and executes a story that does not have to do with the politics but what_happened in the eyes of the soldiers.on the other hand he may tend to be over dramatic the script also does not give enough reason to care for the supporting characters it also gives very cliche motivations for the main ones the first act of the film is also a problem due to the fact that it does not live up to the rest of the film which should have relied more on teamwork than individuals.overall this is a good film with great action acting and last act it is michael_bay's most inspired and respectful film to date.rating 7.5 b very well_done slice of life period piece historical document of sorts enter with a grain of salt like any dramatization of actual_events but the film is top notch.i really don't understand many of the big reviewers i guess it makes them to feel important if they dunk a film like this one in the pond they talk about bad action_sequences and that michael_bay shows disdain for everybody else except america of course well i strongly disagree with this big shot reviewers the movie might be long and can get a little heavy passing the 2 hour mark but it's worth being patient some of the action_sequences are a bit confusing and it gets to a pint that you don't_know whats going n but other than that very well made exciting action packet military insurgence action drama loved it.if i walked in half way through this film i probably would have assumed it was transformers in addition to being a blatantly michael_bay film i feel like i finally have an idea of what_happened at benghazi.decent action movie based_on the true events of the benghazi embassy attack they miscast the cia station chief and didn't even give him any teeth he's still gale from breaking bad character_development was inconsistent the dialogue wasn't very engaging most of the time but there were some scenes that were absolutely stupid.the annex security_team knows that every second counts but james_badge dale wastes 30 seconds to give an unnecessary rhetorical pep talk to his guys who are 100 eager to save american lives you don't have to come but we're the only chance they got 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi isn't your typical michael_bay movie yes it has explosions and cheesy dialogue but it's much more grounded than his usual fare this is an intense film and the performances including a very non jim halpert john_krasinski make it feel more realistic it's hard to watch considering the true_story it's based_on but 13_hours is a movie worth seeing.damn just damn amazing movie.best movie of 2016 can't believe that a lot of the critics rated this so low if they can't relate to the public why are they employed and if they don't like action films they should not watch or rate them great cast and crew awesome storytelling and camera work going with the audiece on this one bad film painfully predictable typical american hero template i struggled not to stop it just from how cheesy it gets at times.great film not sure how this one slipped under the radar it manages to stay politically neutral focusing on the people involved and what_happened on the ground if you enjoyed blackhawk_down you will probably like this to my mind it's much better_than zero_dark thirty or hurt_locker and in fact along with lone_survivor one of the best true_story military action movies of late.i'm rather surprised that michael_bay is capable of making a decent film any longer i thought that the transformers series had ruined him and here he directs something that is actually entertaining the action is actually watchable and i was able to tell what was happening now the characters are just a series a big bearded men that were interchangeable for me and bay still has the habit of putting in both needlessly over patriotic shots and the necessary scenes of talking with the wifey and kids back home film has echoes of black_hawk down and one of the characters even references that so at_least bay knows where he got some of the inspiration for this i'd say that if that was a film that you enjoyed then this will also be a treat for you even if the characters don't grab you as well and the politics a bit more hard hitting then perhaps some will care for.people just hat michael_bay this was a good film i enjoyed very much could have_been 30 mins shorter though just finished 13_hours and it is fantastic.great movie terrible event can't believe are messed up government led by progressive liberals are so corrupt leaving americans to die critics only dislike this movie because they are head in the sand liberals watch this movie and remember hillary abandoned these folkstypical michael_bay movie explosions interrupted by cheesy dialogue with overly long running_time still the script and convincing acting make this movie stand out from bay's filmography perhaps in his case less is more.this film is michael_bays best work to date 13_hours is amazingly acted and is amazingly directed every scene in this film looks amazing john_krasinski delivers a fantastic performance proving he can work past his role in the office the only problem i had with this was that the film dragged from the second to third_act other than that 13_hours the secret_soldiers of behghazi is a great film and is highly recommended.uh ya it looks pretty goodi wouldn't watch it a second time but it delivered an entertaining experience the acting was great and it was beautiful for an action war movie in terms of visual effects and color.mr bay exercises a reasonable level of maturity and restraint yet for all he brings to the table and there is a lot he is still unable to draw focus from his action staging to the power of storytelling on subject_matter so serious.seriously enjoyed this film basically black_hawk down updated for the events of benghazi good story and excellent action pretty solid adaptation of the book too.great movie it was an amazing tribute to the fallen soldiers in benghazi as well as ambassador stevens i thought they did a great job portraying life for u.s soldiers in harms way as well as those that live in places like libya it also did a good job of showing how the u.s government failed to send help and how lives could've been saved if the government had acted sooner or at all not a michael_bay fan but this was an insightful film completely frightening at the repeated onslaughts on the compound good acting by the ensemble_cast i don't think krasinski can do any wrong i think my ears are still ringing from the gunfire.this movie was amazing i found it to be inspirational and reminding of the sacrifices and bonds made by those who want to maintain our_country michael_bay has disappointed us in the past but this is his best movie yet i suggest you watch this movie you won't be disappointed.great film that pays tribute to the heroes in benghazi who risked their_lives and were abandoned by their government.great movie story very emotional and mind grasping great action.decent enough as it was a true_story not a lot of room to adjust the story for creativity's sake just a lot of repetitive holding down the fort action_sequences didn't really like the ending.the movie was great on the edge of my_seat the entire time2 stars bd a long dragged americans vs middle_east terrorists war movie this movie is so bad that it makes me want to watch the dark 30 hours again another bad movie from michael_bay who treated the human soldiers in the movie like the inhuman transformers fighting machines very bad one of the greatest movies i seen yet truly amazing but what i don't like is that america trained soldiers but they train them as sissies if you're being under attack like they were i would have just shot them all no mercy on the ones walking by driving by everyone if they would have did it like that they would have survived with no deaths don't shoot if you don't see a gun screw that its a war zone now but it's a super great movie.a bit too_long but what bay movie isn't this is a gripping tale of americans left to defend themselves against outrageous odds in a country with few allies and some of those are not what they seem either decent characterizations stunning action_sequences better_than average acting and the indomitable will of american soldiers make this a must see.more realistic and less hollywood influenced for a michael_bay movie 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a tensed war movie that reveals the facts surrounding one of the most controversial recent events related to american officials even_though it is overlong and imperfect this is a technically pleasing delivery that does not match the level of an all tiem classic such as black_hawk down but it gets almost there the story covers the events surrounding the time before and during the attack on the american diplomatic compounds in benghazi which led to the death of the american ambassador in libya and several contracted officials it takes a bit longer for the introduction to the actual_events but once the attack begins the tension the action and the realism are simply breath taking despite the fact that the broader audience will be generally familiar with the outcome of the events michael_bay's movie is lacking the typical hollywood cast and relies on unknown guys and that additionally bolsters the overall realism level add to this the incredible mach ism the full throttle machine gun action and you will get the perfect entertainment for men unfortunately what deprives 13_hours from being really an outstanding delivery are several moments before the movie's climax which are awfully clich\\xc3\\xa9d and partially annoying the dialogue of the cia lady with the american military command is probably the weakest part in the whole movie and it will potentially irritate the viewers who are fed up with american clich\\xc3\\xa9s nevertheless 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a pleasing war movie that will impress you with its realism and technical perfection if you are a fan of the genre you will certainly be pleased with the fact that the hollywood influence is limited to just several small scenes and the rest is pretty solid full throttle action 13_hours confus contexte mal pos\\xc3\\xa9 inint\\xc3\\xa9ressant pas pu aller au bout.if you are renting this movie to help make sense of the tragedy in benghazi don't if you want a two hour thrill ride with lots of blowing up and shooting and the occasional blood spatter is not overly offensive rent this.for critics apparently it isn't enough that 13_hours told a true_story without sugar coating it in political correctness the condescension oozes from their reviews as if they are expecting some kind of art masterpiece no this is war pure and simple and no amount of nose thumbing on the part of critics can change that one gets the feeling that the critics are no more pro american than those who attacked the compound and want to justify the attack on the compound as muslim backlash for a video portraying mohammed have fun in your crystal palaces solid acting human figures and excellent directing on the part of michael_bay tell a story that americans should be proud of.just from seeing the movie i know nothing about the characters but it's a decent movie.the action was such a confusion the director makes everyone useless and makes the government even more of an ass.like a shit you tube let's play of cod with shit narrative and zero lolz piss poor.i cannot say that this is michael_bay's best film nor can it compare to other recent middle eastern war films such as american_sniper zero_dark thirty and lone_survivor it is however a solid entry for the war action film genre the storyline feels a bit jumbled though.how anyone can watch this movie and not say that b ch what_happened in benghazi should never have happened we failed these americans all of us by accepting the lies of the obama administration and supporting someone so wicked as hillary_clinton i truly hope everyone watches this movie it definitely secured which side i'm on now here is a movie that is much closer to the top of the michael_bay ladder than most other movies especially recently for the most part the movie is competently directed as long as you can get past the typical michael_bay isms there are lots of firework styled explosions that may look cool but probably don't belong in every scene they are used in the performances are good but some of the dialogue can be cheesy despite some minor flaws this movie is one you can actually take seriously and does a good job honoring the men involved with this horrible incident the movie is also very tense essentially all the way through only the beginning feels a bit slow paced but for the most part the movie goes by pretty quickly sometimes it feels chaotic and you're not sure what is going on but on the same token that is more than likely how those people felt during the crazy situation by the end of it i cared for the characters and it is a very respectful movie it's a well made movie with an emotional center that was better_than i had anticipated definitely worth checking out.it's bad in that bay way still the subject is important and deserving of your attention.in an unfriendly environment they got 13 long hours to survive and resist the attack.it is an action thriller war version of the argo based_on the true_story where the most of the film was the 13 hour long armed battle event took_place in libya 2012 i remember the middle east's protest over the western films this story is set in the same time when the islamic terrorists targeted the american diplomatic compounds in benghazi but six brave_men stood and fought against the uprising.it is an american patriotic film but because of the hatred over their_own countrymen michael_bay they're surely missing a nearly a war masterpiece the rest of the world saw it as a fine film and appreciated that if you haven't_seen it yet i say just don't ignore it it was a well made realistic war film the actors were amazing and the scenes were suspenseful to spectacular definitely one of the best in this theme.it was simply focused on the armed conflict between the two forces so it won't reasons out us how and where it all began because that might take another film to tell the tale that's really a very clever writing in this 150 minute long film the first act was full of characters and story development then begins the gun fight that commences from the dust hours till the dawn breaks out with many twists in the narration during confrontation surely not a film to be missed 8 10reminds me of transformers because i'd be willing to watch it again however it may get worse each repeat viewing so i'll watch it just this once and think of this as a watchable michael_bay film.surprised that michael_bay didn't fully screw up a movie for once especially if it's based_on an accurately true story.awful michael_bay movie with stupid jokes during a serious topicbenghazi benghazi benghazi lolcaptures amazing emotion from every angle.this movie is not necessarily bad but it has a number of issues that in the end just didn't work for me.one of them is the way everything feels calculated and cold.the premise which is based_on true events would've_been better in the hands of a different director in my opinion.one of bay's virtues is in this movie and i think it was not well executed at all 13_hours the secret_soldiers review this was a movie that was slightly hard to follow i guess it was a true_story the acting and script were fine it did grip me i'm not a big fan of this type of filming a movie it's to up close for me fair movie though 6 out of 10 the world is messed up.best war movie since black_hawk down a very well_done movie i was a little skeptical about it since the top billed actor is the guy from the office but he does a great job whereas they do not specifically mention hillary you get the idea and know that the administration abandoned these_men and all the c.i.a personnel at their time of need i'm sure reviews are negative because the left does not want to accept the truth.learn about what really happened in benghazi you owe it to yourself to watch this.although there were a couple of strong performances this film adds further weight that michael_bay films are stories are always terribly cliche stories with unimaginative approaches to depicting action.definitely was no where near zero_dark thirty as in story telling just one of those movie's where you felt like the screen writter was rushed by production of the film if only someone would of took the time this film could of been memorable you can't put a price on being able to live with yourself i'm no critic but i'm having a hard time understanding how some can say the events in this movie are not believable were they there did they fight to save ambassador stevens and the rest of the people working with him and the with the cia have they ever even been to libya highly doubtful since it was based_on the recollections of the actual men involved and many other eyewitnesses i found the story and the timeline of events highly believable it was intense from start to finish and i would highly_recommend it to friends.violent and disturbing truththe primer for the benghazi hearings the real heroes well done.an amazing must_see movie with an incredible true_story i loved it undoubtedly the best michael_bay film since transformers it has good acting some witty banter between characters and very intense action sequences.fantastic movie real facts very realistica sobering reminder of the brutality and senselessness of war.wow a truly inspiring true_story of american heroes a must see.absolutely amazing to see what our boys went through critics only hate it due to their left wing politics.how the critics gave this movie 51 and gave the witch 91 and eye in the sky 95 is beyond my comprehension i'm hesitant now to put any trust in these critic_reviews they are way off the mark with this one.rating 89 though its relentless action and director may make it seem like a bore 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a riveting pulse pounding take on the controversial incident that revitalizes the shock that it originally emitted.probably some of bay's_best work in a long while great casting all the gods all the heavens all the hells are within you too slow paced for me.what happens when a true_story be placed side by side with michael_bay a disaster but props to this movie as it does offer a couple of intense moments albeit bloated at some parts.i don't want to dishonor the people who sacrificed their_lives or were injured serving our great country but i have to say that this movie is typical michael bey junk the script is just so horrible i really had a hard time sitting through the whole thing.when our_country failed to react failed to respond and our secretary of state and president failed these americans and failed america failures should not be rewarded with more opportunities to fail our people fail our_country and fail to have character clinton and obama failed and should not be rewarded for their lack of character.what an impact the actors and director made on the true insecurity and frightening anticipation prior to the attacks it is evident that these soldiers are true heroes and our_government completely failed them how unfortunate that campaigning backgrounds came before the lives and the people that stand strong for our freedom hillary_clinton is a disgrace to the american people it's horrible she doesn't acknowledge any of these facts to this day.very well_done explains what_happened without spewing out names of blame lets the viewer make up their_own mind thanks i thought it was well put together great cast amazing movie made me hate hillary_clinton even more if thats even possible.michael bay is one of the only directors who can take the worst written script in history and still turn it into an amazing movie.i don't even look at critic_reviews any more the user reviews never let me down as in this case this movie was excellent.even though action was highly glorified it connects with the situation it connects with the emotions behind this movie i think critics should spend some time in war zone before writing their lazy ass sitting on the couch sipping their latte review on real war battle based movieswell done and very dramatic portrayal of an event that never should have happened i am grateful there are men and women willing to do what is right over policy i hope we learn a lesson from this experience as a nation the story is as impacting as any other even 9_11 this is an excellent movie and accurately tells the tragic true_story of the terrorist attack in libya on the anniversary of 9_11 don't listen to critics on this one their opinion is based upon their political beliefs.great movie sadly left behind for no reason.this movie truly hits home especially when you have a son who is currently doing this exact thing as a parent of a veteran soldier who truly loves his country it will truly make you appreciate the gift that god has given these_men and women of our_country god_bless america best film i've_seen in years.a great movie very movinggreat movie very touching but action packed.can't help but ask why very intense it really points out how the us government failed to protect the us people there it made it very clear that the us government failed to step up when it should have even after many many requests from the people being attacked.badass military flick if you like movies like black_hawk down you'll like this one.amazing film not just some action movie with explosions every few seconds but a movie with an amzing sotry line the untold lives of the soldiers in bangahzi told in a very exciting and beautiful way.perhaps one of mr bay's_best its sluggish pace nonetheless spurs a strenuous restlessness which given the subject_matter may be its intention.a very meaningful movie one of the most emotional movies i have ever_seen it conveys messages hard to be presented to an audience of all ages but having as a fact that the incident had happenned in real_life did support the effort of the director to form a universal message got borught up by the movie by only making those six men's lifes known to the people is a social act of honour and patriotism the movie deserves 5_stars because of the excellent performance of the actors as well as for the sole idea of the creation of such a movie 13 hour has all the action and explosions that you may ask for it feels like 2.5 hours of call of duty the visual is stunning but too monotonic and at some point it's hard to tell what's happening mainly due to confusing editing which is by the way unintentional.the biggest weakness is how the story turns empty and is hijacked with the non_stop action scenes.you could say that it's heavily politically charged.that aside it's entertaining and a good depiction of war scense.difficult movie to judge it does reflects the reality of the events but in a very para military way but then the film can be taken from their point of view the story has it's dull and long moments so i skipped all the long personal moments because of that it's not a documentary the acting is unequal but intense during stressing times fx sounds are good bay is in it's element but does the film really feels right i think the delays and the lack of responses from other parties is not well displayed in the story it makes the story more weak because you feel that something went wrong there but it's almost not told a real doc film should be necessary eventually.very patriotic i liked it.not sure how much subtlety you can expect from a war film but the action scenes are among the best i've_ever scene from the genre it also does a wonderful job of navigating the harrowing experience without ever actually dealing with the deeper political impact and root cause of the incident does a solid job as long as you dont scratch too far beneath the surface resonant line jack_silva you can't put a price on being able to live with yourself john_krasinski that's all that brings this up from a 1 10 and the opening scene was pretty good awful direction cinematography that doesn't work for the movie messy writing no emotion all the other performances are forgettable and way too_long the movie is messy and confusing and has no emotion which makes it hard to care about the characters or anything for that matter it's just typical bay action and explosions and the action isn't even good michael_bay's at it again.in the trenches inspired by true events this is about a small group of soldiers in benghazi in 2012 nobody knows they are stationed there so when an american diplomatic_compound one mile away from them gets attacked they are quite literally the only ones who can help but it would require compromising their cover i have a love hate relationship with michael_bay he's got talent but he just chooses not to use it more often than not which is why i get frustrated with him i would be totally fine with the transformers series ceasing to exist but i do tend to enjoy bay's smaller projects where he can pull back and subdue like the rock or the hilariously insane pain_gain 13_hours is a more inspired offering from bay and while it isn't perfect it does have plenty of good going for it you can make comparisons to a number of different video games as this is pretty close to being call of duty modern_warfare the movie and it would be hard to make a counterargument it's very much a war movie with modern weaponry and it's made by the patriotic michael_bay so you know this is going to have plenty of flag waving regardless this movie does a great job of putting you right there in the moment even in the quieter parts it always feels like it is just a wrong dialogue exchange away from everything going completely wrong so it stays tense for practically the entire movie playing out like a macho less cerebral sicario it gets intense during the thick of the action and one of the most interesting elements to this is the chaos and confusion these_guys have to deal with the city isn't completely filled with extremist enemies and there are natives that are sided with the americans that said there is no sound way of telling who is who and it creates this engaging dynamic where you can never trust anyone even if they just told you that they are on your side all positives aside this is not a perfect film this is a cast that is made up of almost entirely bros but it makes sense given the fact that everybody here is military however in the heat of the action it can be hard to tell all these manly beaded men apart it is a bit of a challenge to take krasinski seriously as he typically plays the straight man who mugs for the camera but he does do well enough here my biggest complaint about this is that it runs about 30_minutes too_long and you feel the length i don't_know what i would necessarily cut out but if this fell in the 2 hour range it would be a tighter more compact story still i feel positive enough about 13_hours to give it a decent recommendation 13_hours was the best opening ceremony to kick start the year of 2016 with pumped up action and boiling testosterone michael_bay returns to war torn battlegrounds only this time replacing robots with war veterans.intense action filled just proved how there are too many idiots in positions of authority.excellent portrayal of unbelievable events non political but can't hide the fact our_government exposed our people to terrorists by not providing protection in a hot zone.way too_long action shots were over the top sometimes acting was seriously okay repetitive scenes but not a bad attempt from bay overall an okay film.fantastic utterly disgusted by the lack of response from our administration and by the lack of intellectual honesty about what really happened.i will give bay this it was nice for him to actual deal with a story involving real people and the lack of terrible sexual puns or terrible jokes this felt like it could've been better in a better directors hands bay does not know how to film action at all everything is all over the place and nothing has emotion to it krasinski was actually very convincing as a military type and should spread his acting wings more often it wasn't awful but not really well made either.i'll give it a half a star because i managed to finish it but the obvious political implications and poor fact checking coupled with the lack of adherence to journalistic integrity this is put over as a documentary after all just makes this one long giant eye roll the cia guy treats the alphas that are there to apparently protect him and his team like dirt with such a few number of people huddled in a small area in a war zone more or less the idea that they aren't working together on a deeper level to rely on eaxheachmichael bay's action pack war movie is based_on true events the film simply is too_long for all the firing and bombings without making any effort on building the characters a waste of time.this movie is awesomegreat story great storytelling heroes really do exist after the obama clinton debacle in libya turns it into a terrorist mecca and repeated requests for protection by the ambassador go unheeded american assets in benghazi come under attack with incredible valor 6_men on the ground save dozens of people while the suits in washington continue to f up the response should have won every oscar available 7 10 spoiler alert i wonder why us government ignored to help their people there.great action scenes falls flat everywhere else.amazing movie truely shows how sick and corrupt the obama clinton administration has been and how brave the men who fight and die for our_country are they deserve way more respect than they get god_bless our troops.whoah fantastic cast of actors and fantastic action_sequences equates to one thrilling movie.took me by surprise but this is michael_bay's best film in a long time i enjoyed this a lot more than american_sniper if you like black_hawk down then i highly_recommend 13 hours.one of the best movies this year.this was a great movie about a totally avoidable and tragic event how different the outcome might have_been if the politicians in charge hillary and obama knew that the lives of their families were on the line.nothing speaks louder of the misjustice and corruption than those four body bags lying on the tarmac in libya the inaction of executive branch a holes destroyed families this was utterly avoidable they should be in prison for what they did.i am grateful to bay for bringing this to the awareness of the public in this movie.great movie if you like your war movies then this a musta thought_provoking intense ride.very close to black_hawk downhere is this movie's premise in one sentence tough_guys meet tough_guys shown sitting around saying tough guy stuff with more tough_guys tough_guys try to appear normal with family back drops tough_guys predict trouble shooting and fires start tough_guys start running and shooting for over an hour i turn the movie off.what's going on here and who are these people this movie lacks so much starting with meaning or depth that's it's not even worth taking the time to explain it it's horrible and i still don't_know why all of those people lost their_lives other than so hollywood could attempt to glorify it.this film is truly amazing ignore the fact that it was made by michael_bay and just try to put yourself in that specific situation.gripping action thriller in the vein of blackhawk downgood movie every american should watch this prior to the 2016 election never forget clinton's crass remark what difference at this point does it make she lied about the cause being a youtube video even lying to ambassador chris stephens mother as she stood next to his casket truth and honor are more important than any clinton excuse honor the memory of ambassador stevens and the three others who gave their life defending the embassy vote for anyone other than clinton.surprisingly i liked this film from michael_bay based_on a true_story it is a tense and exciting film and bay handles the action very well the performances are decent i actually like john_krasinski as an action hero he is a big guy and very fit so he has the physicality but he also has an intelligence and vulnerability lacking in this type of role the problem for me was that the film is very one sided and i think it would've_been well served by a deeper examination of the situation in benghazi and what led to the incident depicted in the film it is almost 2 1 2 and the second_half of the film plays like an extended action sequence so a little more character_development for this real_life story would've_been appreciated that being said it was better_than i was expecting and i liked it.the wussy from the office failed to carry an action movie who thought that was a good idea i feel bad that i waited for this movie to come out on dvd instead of seeing it the theater i loved this movie and it ranked right up there with black_hawk down i was surprised that it was not more political it felt like you there in the moment and it was not told with a slant of hindsight.one of michael_bays better films that kept_me interested throughout they also finally do his explosion fetish in a good wayone of the best movies i have seen i recommend a rarity in michael_bay's career a film that shows restraint in the spectacle he creates despite some overuse in certain editing traits mainly slow_motion shots it's the one michael_bay film since the transformers sequels i can wholeheartedly recommend.i was waiting something different.i didn't realise benghazi was such a messy affair it's terrible that military support was not provided on the basis that the cia weren't supposed to be there in the first place.equally good as american_sniper great film i would see it 10 times it is a dramatic increase in quality for bay back to his roots when his action films actually had feeling too much filler though and an overally long conclusion 13_hours has a solid action filled middle and a accurate depiction of its true facts.quite similar to the black_hawk down but the arrangement is more balanced to reduce the over tension part.delivers on everything you want it to the acting isn't bad a few laughs along the way not brilliantly acted but if that's what you were going for then you missed the point still have watched a michael_bay film i disliked despite everyone ranting about his excessive use of pyrotechnics this film called for that and he delivered in earnest the book is also a fantastic read.fantastic movie about the unfortunate events at benghazi.anyone who reviewed this movie poorly is an assholeloved it felt like you were there with them.wow micheal_bay can make a good film the action is thrilling and the characters are cookie cutter characters but still it is still a good time at the movies maybe matinee pricing would be better.not bad but the develop is not so clear and the responsability maybe is hidden 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a biographical war film directed by michael_bay and written by chuck hogan it stars james_badge dale john_krasinski max_martini pablo_schreiber and toby stephens on the main roles based_on a true_story the film follows six members of a security_team who fight to defend the american diplomatic_compound in benghazi_libya after waves of terrorist_attacks on september_11 2012 the directing in this movie is really good and for that i have to credit michael_bay because even_though he has made some not so good movies in the recent years i knew he had talent and he certainly shows it in this one the cinematography is also great by dion beebe but what stands out to me the most is the score composed by lorne balfe it brought up the emotions when needed to and it made us feel for these people a lot throughout the acting is superb all around but the two shinning stars are james_badge dale and especially john_krasinski who had to play out most of the emotional scenes and he pulled out like a pro the movie has caused some controversy since it is based_on a true_story that happened back in 2012 but the politic elements are smartly not touched upon on this movie as we are really just seeing the movie from these six guy's eyes they do not know what is happening yet they have the courage to take some action and actually save lives it did start to feel like it is a bit too_long by the end and it does have some shaky_cam here and there but really those are the only negatives that i found in my_opinion this is a very well made movie and definitely one of if not the best bay film ever powerful heartbreaking account as mr rogers said in eesponse to tragedy and evil in the world look for the helpers this movie is about 6 helpers against odds restoring my hope in humanity it is a michael_bay movie stuff blows up the narrative is heart wrenching.gut gemachter kriegsfilm.great movie through and through heavy action and you will not be disappointed.i liked this movie it has a lot of action but kept_me entertained with its plot.hollywood devotion for patriotism on film have brought us great films exploring the lives of heroes who protect the liberties of americans movies such as the hurt_locker black_hawk down lone_survivor presents a powerful stories where soldiers have a basic task which is protect civilians and stop the enemy in michael_bay's 13_hours the secret_soldiers of bengazi he tales the tale of the attack in 2012 of the us embassy in benghazi_libya the city is named one of the most_dangerous cities in the world but still the center of operations of for cia and the us government on libya's soil the arrival of navy seal jack_silva john_krasinski brings two friends together silva and james_badge dale tyrone woods along with the rest of the marines are there for the protection of the ambassador in a non so secure compound where the operations takes place at the same time a private military contractors are protecting the annex a not so secret cia outpost a team of private contractors the film focus on a single point of view of the story but is not focusing of understand what really happen on this attack michael_bay do what he does best deliver action and energetic scenes of conflict were the only common element is entertain when you first start watching this movie you noticed that the characters are weak there is no real connection with the audience and the intention of critiquing the controversial events parallel to the attack were the us government failure to support their forces in benghazi is just a glimpse of a few seconds scene the film intend to be like other more powerful films like black_hawk down and lone_survivor but fail miserably but just presenting a action film with a sad turn of events biopic films require not only require good cinematography good camera work energetic editing but a good researched script.lots of action but you do need to understand the story to really like the movie could be hard to follow if you don't_know the circumstances.michael bay is able to restrain himself and create a mature and respectful biographical war film while the build_up drags and the characterization is lacking the performances are strong and the action scenes are tense and harrowing with the film culminating in a riveting final act.good acting great dialogue and a compelling story intense and heavy at_times it'll make you mad and it'll make you proud.one of the best movies i have ever_seen and will ever see 13_hours is the kind of picture that harkens back to the michael_bay of old specifically the michael_bay of the rock his strength has always been highly polished action and the surprise here isn't that his latest is an impressively mounted action film but alas a rather coherent one as well.this riveting film about the bravery of four american patriots who gave their_lives defending us ambassador christopher stevens and 26 other us citizens from a fundamental islamic terrorists attack in libya on september_11 2012 is a must_see for every american who cares deeply about those who defend us from islamic terrorism here and abroad god_bless these_men and their families michael_bay did an amazing job with this movie this is a really great movie with a perfect cast and great suspense unfortunately this is a great movie about how the world is filled with terrible people and how terrible things happen because of other terrible people just an all around buzz kill.better than i expected because it's from cia security contractors you won't be seeing any political drama which is good since we already knew on tv it's definitely chaos and miscommunication between us and bases over there straight forward love the sound score didn't realized it's 144 min long so it's worth the money b grade.a whole lot of american hero momentswonderful movie that everyone needs to see.awesome unless youre a liberal hillary voter that doesnt like the truth.one of michael_bays best films.pros that was really pretty entertaining if you combined black_hawk down and lone_survivor this is what you got but i think it is a tad better compare to the two with less shaky cams and great action great sound the explosions the gun sounds are fantastic those 50 cal bullets spraying all over is badass i think the script is well written compared to any other bay films i mean he should stick to films like these and stay from the pg transformers trash this is his forte some scenes are intense man it has that feels especially the actors are pretty good in this film one of the best military action filcks since act of valor i love that film so much cons too_long too many pauses action conversation action must maintain the story's momentum.verdict get it on blu ray pumped up your volume and listen to the amazing gun sounds and explosions.unfortunately 13_hours secret_soldiers of benghazi had almost no mention of former secretary of state hillary_clinton on what she didn't do to save these brave soldiers during the night michael_bay delivers an intensity to the film making it feel like you're actually there which other movies in my_opinion fail to do the way michael_bay does it.if you have not seen this you really should i am not making any comments on a corrupt govt more about our soldiers in the field hurrah as we would say in england.a slow beginning to a rather action_packed tension filled ending if you liked american_sniper and or the lone_survivor then you'll enjoy this.these mixed reviews are obviously political i've_seen this movie over 20 times point being as a registered independent who used to really respect hillary_clinton and usama obama this artistic action film based_on a very true_story was a footnote version of obama and clinton w another cover up w their story to the press that ambassodor stephens was attacked along w his outpost and followed by the cia annex base guarded by gsr cia spy's was all caused by a anti semitic film against muslims in which caused a very violent protest test bullshit this movie explains the beginning of isil not isis and the brave ex seals marines cia agents and an army ranger out gunned and out manned 1000 1 and these_guys held these terroist jihadis extremist all night until help arrived the next day the cia spy's tradecraft workers contacted every single qrf in a 400 750 mile radius air force and navy bases equipped with armed drones f 16 s and apache black_hawk helicopters that could of been there to help or at_least by time with a f 16 fly by or a gunship to scare these terroist away until the evac started w libyan government help but of course the secretary of state hrc and obama all said no we lost a at the the time an active navy seal glen daughtery working in tripoly for the cia we also lost the number 1 and most experienced contractor and former navy seal tyrone woods along w the dismantling of his company gsr i'm not sure who i'm voting for and this movie does not help hrclinton but this is a very good flick that puts things the best what it can within 2hours and a few minutes the more i watch the more i understand the even more i love the making of this movie rtsolid plot throughout the whole movie raw intense informative dare i say this movie give you a glimpse on what happens in the shadows all the black ops and all the top secret spying going around all over the world which is clearly something to worry about and actually admire in a sense all in all good movie and i very much enjoyed it in its entiretya great movie everyone should see to understand what is happening in the middle_east and how benghazi happened.reminded me of black_hawk down not quite as good but i enjoyed iti thought i knew the truth but this showed so much more no disrespect but the ambassador put himself in danger the security detail he had was inadequate however the administration should have done more to protect him a very michael_bay movie gratefully boosted with many more of his strengths than his weaknessesvery solid action flick was surprised to see krasinski cast in this type of movie but he held his own definitely worth_watching unless you're a political junkie then it'll just leave your really pissed off regardless of whether you lean blue or red this movie sucks you right into the action and you don't realize you just gave up 2 1 2 hours of your life to watch people machines and buildings being blown up that being said my main objection to this movie is the ridiculously long running_time the cast is great the emotional impact is devastating and the special_effects are intense it just needs to cut about an hour of the exploding of things.for all intents and purposes it's an effective movie however some aspects felt inauthentic i've never been a military contractor in libya but somehow i doubt they constantly shout clich\\xc3\\xa9d military adages to each_other in order to prove they once were enlisted this issue is only exacerbated as the story goes on these elite contractors wondering aloud why shepherds are herding their flock at night baffled by what a terrorist might be doing with his cell phone or reminding everyone that the enemy is likely to attack at dawn i understand there was a need to fill in non military folk with explanations but the balance resulted in the contractors seeming incompetent at_times something that i'm certain was not actually the case.that being said the last hour of this movie was worth sitting through the patronizing first hour.lots of action seems like last hour or so is one big battle not badgreat action_packed suspenseful movie with a great cast.what a great movie the true_story of 6_men who risked their_lives to save the american ambassador in benghazi this movie is a must_see good story bad editingedge of my_seat action even while i knew the ending.garbage exploitation film will appeal to republicans and other low iq viewers.excellent well done.i can understand why many democrats do not like this movie it shows how badly obama and clinton handle this mess.i thought that the story this film this is based off of is a great idea for a big picture movie however i felt the acting was a bit dry and writing of the film was poor and something we've seen multiple times already i did think that the battle scenes were very well shot and the cinematography was great also the audio is on point and besides who doesn't love a bit of jim halpert i think the reason i don't particularly care for war films is because they are by their very nature chaotic they are filmed with fast cuts and numerous changes in perspective so as to capture the chaotic feeling of battle and rarely maintain a true narrative flow the cinematography of 13_hours does this well enough the action is choreographed brilliantly and things become very confusing and raw as things escalate this is what michael_bay specializes in as his in the moment style keeps tensions high 13_hours is more a story of equal parts war story as well as one of survival the weakest part of the film is probably the beginning wherein bay attempts to establish characters but they are all more or less the same characters each and every one it's the quiet moments that suffer most as well because it's not nearly as gripping as the action scenes now of course we need the quiet scenes to allow the audience a momentary reprieve to contemplate what has played out they also further build character but as we've established its so hard to differentiate them all from each_other actually for a film about conflict there is surprisingly little dynamic between the characters lastly can we please get someone who understands the technicals behind film lighting for a film that takes place over the course of 13_hours there seems to be an awful lot of night day shifts.final thoughts not terrible raw and tense action scenes carry most of the film but the human element just isn't there.the secret_soldiers of benghazi was a movie i had heard about briefly but had no real interest in until my dad mentioned it to me and we sat down and watched it i was surprised to see the name michael_bay attached to this at the end credits but it was actually a really good watch full of action as you'd expect from a michael_bay movie it was also rather tense at_times i always like a true_story as well good performances from john_krasinski i think it was the first movie i've_seen him in or at_least in a main role.it will make you angry you just don't leave our people behind this genre feels like a film michael_bay is best at.reminiscent of black_hawk down with the gross mismanagement of the officials responsible for the travesty being similarly glossed over the film is action_packed and is a must_see even for those who unbelievably may not be familiar with the story 13_hours does suffer from the style of its director the use of slow_motion low angled camera shots and the very glossy camera look does scream michael_bay however michael_bay directs his best movie in a decade 13_hours is a very solid movie it's a well directed well_acted intense and at_times emotionally moving movie that pays respect to the brave_men who fought at benghazi back in 2012 i'm saddened this was a true_story what a great depiction of those dreadful events awesome for action michael_bay has been frustratingly slow to mature as a filmmaker his mind absorbed in the gigantic toy sets of the transformers films for almost a decade but with 13_hours a butt numbing nerve shreddingly intense ground zero recreation of the 2012 battle of benghazi his virtuostic use of colour motion and sound this is one of the movie's technical standouts has finally been used for something approaching the power of good all the usual criticisms of his work stay intact and in this politically charged but apolitical depiction his occasional insensitivity to anyone who isn't an american male is particularly uncomfortable but it's blown away by his ferocious technical mastery his ability to marshall chaos on his sets and shoot them with something approaching a visceral abstraction but more notably and for the first time in a long time there is a genuine tangible emotional connection to the material allowing the film's final coda to have genuine poignant power we feel as pummelled as confused as scared and as adrenalised as these soldiers we are with them not watching them.a fitting tribute to the men and women who fought and gave their_lives that night in benghazi 13_hours is a solid directorial effort from michael_bay the performances are strong particularly from john_krasinski and james dale the action is in your face and appropriately photographed really putting the audience in the thick of battle.goods great action interesting topic well_acted one big cluster frack not political just tell what from there point of view over all enjoy able movie remind me of black_hawk downall the way incredible fascinating realistic shocking heroic loved this movie i've_seen it 5 times.reminded me of black_hawk down but it had me hooked from the startthis movie is actually really moving despite the story not being followed as accurately as possible it still gives a good glimpse of what's been happening in libya over the years.i honestly have trouble seeing how critics can dislike this movie unless they just gleefully strike down anything depicting americans as the good guys what seems unfortunately lost is just how ridiculously good krasinski and david_denman are yes the movie is a probably a bit over the top but the action scenes are amazing and the acting though again over the top at_times has subtlety craft and overwhelming emotion at key points don't let shitty overly politicizing critics dissuade you but also definitely don't what with anyone under 16 years old.good movie i'm watching the massive screw up hilary is trying to cover up.this move was amazing very violent but very interesting to see what_happened in benghazi i would recommend this if you like military cia movies.a sad statement on those in power who ignored the pleas for help with a fine ensemble_cast and terrific battle sequences 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a gripping action thriller that's also factual and distinctive dvd movie review 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazidate viewed june 16 2016directed by michael_bay bad_boys bad_boys ii armageddon the rock pain_gain and transformers screenplay by chuck hogan based_on the novel 13_hours by mitchell zuckoff and members of the annex security teamstarring john_krasinski james_badge dale max_martini dominic fumusa pablo_schreiber matt letscher david_denman toby stephens alexia barlier freddie stroma and david giuntoli.it caused a major political firestorm during the 2012 presidential campaign and dragged then secretary of state hillary_clinton out of office the september_11 2012 terrorist_attacks in benghazi_libya killed four americans including u.s ambassador chris stevens and it became a red retriever for congressional republicans who scrutinized clinton for failing to protect the u.s embassy and failing to put more security forces on the ground director michael_bay armageddon the rock bad_boys transformers pushes the political backlash still surrounded it aside and salutes to those who fought and sacrificed everything just to protect the u.s compound.unfortunately for the hillary haters out there this film doesn't name or mention hillary_clinton not even once i know what you're thinking right now michael_bay is a clinton supporter clinton gave bay and the producers money just to protect her back people can believe what they want but as a critic i must review 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi as a movie not as a hit job on clinton i'm sorry but that's my job.as an action movie it's really violent chaotic and overlong but it is a more restrained effort from michael bay.almost a year after the u.s government ousted libyan dictator muammar gadhafi from power libya has now become a breeding ground for numerous terrorist groups with countries starting to pull their embassies out of libya the u.s still has their diplomatic_compound and a secret cia outpost called the annex present and it's up to six private military contractors to protect the compound at all costs the six men who are made up of former military personnel tyrone s rone woods james_badge dale jack_silva john_krasinski mark oz geist max_martini john tig tiegen dominic fumusa kris tanto paronto pablo_schreiber and dave boon benton david_denman are given strict reminders by their cia chief boss bob david_costabile to do everything by the book and avoid contact with libyan extremists.when u.s ambassador chris stevens matt letscher arrives all hell starts to break lose as dozens of libyan extremist fighters storm into the compound and try to find stevens and his diplomat sean smith christopher dinngli who have locked themselves in the bathroom the islamic militants then burn the compound down and the grs contractors try to find stevens and smith the team manages to find smith who dies from smoke inhalation but they can't find stevens.despite orders from their boss to stay put at the annex the grs team led by woods and silva do what they have to do to protect the embassy and fight back against the terrorists.with a fine ensemble_cast and terrific battle sequences 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a gripping action thriller that's also factual and distinctive.after helming three transformers sequels michael_bay was a perfect choice to direct 13_hours because he knows chaos pretty well the screenplay by novelist chuck hogan is a bit confusing and has little hillary bashing going on but 13_hours which is based_on mitchell zuckoff's non fiction book is a grueling film that does a great service to those families who lost their loved ones on that faithful day in benghazi 13_hours is a film from michael_bay that is actually rather good what is this yes this film does cater towards bay's usual style of giant flashy and loud explosions and somewhat shaky action_sequences at_times but it's overall more mature and much more competently made than past films of his this film is overall rather entertaining for the mist part and it mostly respects the true_story aspect of the situation that the soldiers were in at the time there were also some surprisingly wise choices made with the screenplay overall 13_hours is a pretty decent mindless january action flick that wouldn't be bad to check out on a rainy day and i honestly wouldn't mind maybe visiting this one a second time in the future so far january hasn't been that bad with two decent films to come out so far what could go wrong i thought this movie was great a lot of action and explosions etc i thought the critics would have gave a better rating.how do you like your propaganda film heavy handed agenda with a side of patriotism it's pretty obvious who the target demographic for this movie was so going into this i knew how it was going to shake down really had it been a fictional movie sure i'd give it points for being a decently made thriller despite michael_bay's name being attached to this eh not a failure overall i'd much rather watch this again than any of bay's other recent box office turds.i really tried to like this movie but it was way too_long and had no real storyline now zero_dark thirty that was phenomenal.the most beautifully shot action movie in the history of cinema.the movie clearly indicates that the us gov't never issued an order to rescue the ambassador that night i rarely watch anything re history however i wanted a spelled out explanation about this i feel like i learned.most of the critic_reviews on this site are from clueless trash bags.this film was heart wrenching the critics say that the banter between characters was out of place let me tell you that's how marines and other operators talk it's not made up also how they managed to stay alive against a force like that it happened because those guys are alive to live and tell the tale the reason they think it put a negative spin on the rebels in libya is because the rebels in libya did it to themselves they attacked a us embassy compound and tried to ambush another compound it's not made up it happened.most of these people just sat in the theater rolling their eyes because michael_bay's name was on it and this was about american soldiers they haven't_seen the eyes of guys that have just come from firefights they just don't_know this film made me miss all of my guys from afghanistan and only lone_survivor was more difficult for me to watch definitely check this film out if you liked lone_survivor american_sniper or black_hawk down.john karsinski in action movie never thought about it and never ever cross my mind that he'll do this kind of film but hey just like his wife emily blunt i never thought about it either only the difference is that emily killed it from the devil wears prada to edge of tomorrow c'mon guys she successfully play the badass girl while her husband did not all i'm watching in here is that john as jack whining just want to come back to u.s and be with his family esp when he heard that his wife got pregnant again after so many children that they already have this is based_on a true event so i don't_know maybe that's how this jack really going through and sadly john karsinski got to play him and he make a debut in action movie with a bad review because of it dreview i surprisingly really enjoyed this film because it felt like you was one of the soldiers fighting for your life and the intensity throughout was brilliant the director cleverly spent some time to let the audience get to know the various soldiers and he gave an in depth look into there different tactics in combat i was a bit skeptical when i saw that it was nearly 2 and a half hours long but it really needed to be and the fact that it was based_on true events made it a truly amazing story rone james_badge dale was a true leader and he pushed his heroic soldiers to the limit to save his fellow americans the chemistry between the actors made the movie seem real and the way that the movie was shot especially in combat was great jack_silva john_krasinski wasn't the most charismatic soldier but he didn't crumble under pressure mainly because he knew that his squad would die for each_other when i saw the real soldiers at the end i did find it touching and quite emotional and it's obvious that the tragic events that happened in benghazi over those 13_hours must have_been traumatic because a lot of the soldiers retired afterwards anyway i personally found this film really entertaining and it should have made more money at the box office enjoyable round up:this epic war movie was directed by michael_bay 51 who has made some decent movies like pain_gain which i really enjoyed the transformers franchise the island pearl_harbor armageddon the rock and the bad_boys franchise he is due to release the next transformers movie the last knight in 2017 with mark wahlberg and josh duhamel so he's obviously one to deal with big budgets and working with big stars judging by his other movies he decided to keep this true_story extremely raw and he picked the right cast to portray this remarkable story budget 50millionworldwide gross 70millioni recommend this movie to people who are into their action drama thrillers starring john_krasinski pablo_schreiber james_badge dale david_denman and dominic fumusa 7 10day sundaydate 30 july 2016time 10.00 pmwith maaon hdtvsuch an amazing and emotional movie the lives that are risked daily for reasons only known to those that repeatedly attack us are hardly publicized this movie is one of the reasons that i stopped watching the news because there's nothing good happening in the world only violence and death it's 2016 people and we still cannot live peacefully amongst each_other i love john_krasinski and this is by far his best role yet god_bless america and god_bless those that fight to defend our freedom day in and day out truthful and fierce story but lack of dramatic although it's really real plots repeating and spreading lengthy storyline that doesn't reach a necessary climax makes me almost sleep mr bay seems made an oath to keep making long and sleepy films after pearl harbor.excellent movie based_on the true accounts of american marines caught behind enemy lines in benzaghi and the ordeal of having to fight and survive until backup arrives literally not to be missed 13_hours is a michael_bay film that attempts to tug at your emotions and make you attached to its characters overall though it fails as nearly all the characters are bland and the writing stale however tense action_sequences and bay's signature style of film make this movie somewhat enjoyable.not a very complex film but 13_hours tells a heartfelt story and the action_sequences don't leave much to be desired.i didn't have much knowledge about the true_story prior to watching this film so at first it was kind of hard to follow however i'm glad i took the time to view it.interesting movie i liked the one guy with the beard good actor.suspenseful great show case of how the us govt likes to leave their_own behindif you fancy yourself a big swingin dick yank then i'd recommend you watch 13_hours but of course you already have.i can move past the xenophobia and jingoism pretty easily even the typical bay tropes don't ruin a movie for me but what i find difficult to abide is boredom and with 13_hours i personally found that in spades.though it doesn't make a whole lot of sense though i didn't care about any of the characters and though i am giving this film a negative review i can still say it's michael_bay's best work in years.i've watched this movie over five times since it came out it's the real story of what_happened to the americans in benghazi we own the blu ray it's a lot to take in but it's worth a watch.regardless the argument of this true event this is a well made war movie with good intended message.very intense bay just loves to keep the pedal to the floor was pleasantly surprised with krasinski as well as the majority of the cast.horrible overwrought piece of junk cliches around very corner fodder for simple minded reactionaries.decent film pretty good action scenes this is definitely michael_bay's most mature movie i've_seen in a while score 57 100it's definitely more restrained than literally all of michael_bay's previous efforts but given the important story surrounding the film it wasn't as powerful and impactful as i hoped it would've_been the cast is fantastic with john_krasinski being the real standout it has beautiful cinematography and some great action scenes but i just couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by the end it's definitely better_than most of bay's efforts i just wasn't affected by it as much as i was hoping.decent war movie provided you are willing to overlook the always abundant americanism in hollywood films is viewed pleasantly plus a restrained michael_bay direction.bullets and more bulletsvery solid movie great action with a very visceral violence the cast was great and the setting was well_done a little long and took a bit to get going but overall a good movie.phenomenal movie on an event i'm ashamed to have not known more about until now powerful story telling that asks questions vital to our continued democratic nation could not have_been more wrong in my initial judgement of this movie from the trailer one of the best ways i could imagine spending 2hr 20min learning about an important event witnessing great courage and honoring those involved riveting eye_opening and sad 13_hours is an inspirational story of patriotism courage and doing what's right director michael_bay has proven how to tell a true_story i love this film and hope people will enjoy it but like always there are a few cons.terribly produced the action was good but the cringe worthy human interludes were poorly timed and poorly developed the sound was awful and i think i skipped through more than half of it.who would think that a michael_bay film in january would be this good easily his best movie since the rock 71 b read the book and still was not prepared for the movie.me gusto la ves y no tedas cuenta que dura 2 horas y mediagood sad docudrama.powerful movie and angering at the same time must_see movie about our heroes amazing movie in every respect it's based_on facts from the memories of those who lived through such hell i know a lot of world affairs i do my best to read world news and american news made outside of the usa and i pick my sources carefully and i know many americans die protecting america's interests nevertheless seeing this movie it really touched my soul because it's one thing reading and seeing pictures and know facts but seeing it's something else.the best frustrating thing about this movie is the fact that you relive the bay rock days and find he can actually make a good film that not 93 dick jokes every once and awhile well_done executed and shot all of which gets extra points for sitting through a almost 3 hr movie for a subject that i didnt really know and or care to much about to invest that amount of time well_done bay and team.special kudos to james_badge dale who i feel blew it out of the park.white people with beards and guns smart and good white people from universities dumb and bad libyans thieves and bad explosions murica setting politics aside i don't count on michael_bay for nuanced political takes and neither should you i thought this was a riveting exciting and sobering movie it was a little long but otherwise no complaints.grade b well made great effects acting unequal many simplistic views in the script but all in all very entertaining.they go to a country mess things up and make a film so we feel sorry about them make no mistake though this was quite entertaining.not bad for a michael_bay filmexcellent film although as usual with these american films too much fiction thrown in amongst the facts to big up the usa.puts a prospective about why we would let these americans die it could have_been prevented.it's been at_least eleven years if not more since michael_bay made a decent movie so it's nice to know that with a limited budget and a story that requires restraint he can actually still pull it off on netflix.if you have ever been a soldier then this movie will deeply move you because of the impact that it has on an individual that goes through combat and loses a brother in arms i think it's portrayed well and honors then ones who lived through this terrible ordeal.good from a true_story point of view.action packed based_on a true_story should be made to declare how true well_done eye_opening true_story but story seemed too drawn out at one point i was hoping everyone would die and the movie would be over it dragged.i don't_know what's better american_sniper or this it's a great movie best movie of the year want to watch it again based_on true events 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is an intense war drama from director michael_bay the film follows the terrorist attack on the american embassy in benghazi_libya on september_11 2012 in which a small elite security_team went to the rescue of the embassy and had to hold off an army of insurgents starring john_krasinski james_badge dale max_martini and david_costabile the cast is fairly good and gives some very strong performances the writing however is a little weak and does a poor job at setting up the characters and the situation in libya leading_up to the attack yet once the attack hits the film shifts into high gear and doesn't let up until the end delivering intense and exciting action_sequences 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi has its problems but is still a thrilling real_life story of courage and sacrifice.best modern day war movie since black_hawk downfor a michael_bay movie this was definitely a nice change from his usual nauseating action movies not sure how factual or accurate it was but regardless performances were solid and the story for what it was very engrossing.thrilling but less gore than in most warecent movies all in all a well told true_story 13_hours is a film based_on a true_story by micheal_bay and unlike his last two attempts to do this type of a movie this time it's actually pretty dang good of course there's some bayhem in place here massive explosions and parts where i felt like i hardly had time to catch my breath but this time it was in small doses and the rest of the film wasn't filled with lame jokes and asshats for characters believe it or not i think bay really took himself seriously as a director and wanted everyone to know it the acting is all really good so good there were points when i forgot i was watching a movie and not a recording of the real thing i really enjoyed 13_hours it was a little long in that micheal_bay way where you feel like you could've skipped 20_minutes and the beginning was a little slow but overall i'd say this made me think of black_hawk down a little bit a better film in my_opinion but the similarities were thereaction packed from start to finish not necessarily a good thing either and a little bit too_long but still tells a good story of what_happened that night.way too drawn out thin characters brutal surface dialogue but nonetheless tame use of bay isms and therefore still entertaining in some senses.deserved a more skilled director than bay but for a bay film it's definitely one of his best.\\xc3\\xb0 best modern combat film i've_seen since black_hawk zero darki cant believe it but michael_bay made a great movie gritty action cool story a solid moviewe see an intense fire fight once the crux of the film begins and it's shot with pace has good tension with a very gritty setting all of which are a credit to the director.i didn't know anything about benghazi before this highly_recommend this movie apparently there's some drama with hillary_clinton lying about how this attack was caused by a viral video but in fact it was because of this secret cia_base the movie has nothing to do with hillary_clinton or that cover up but it's the amazing story of this small group of ex marines army rangers and navy_seals acting as military contractors protecting this secret cia_base after libya's government had just recently fallen it's an intense edge of your_seat true_story of what_happened that day.very intense in telling the story of benghazi though it did add the human element at_least from the american pov and told of how we arrived at that point very well_done though of course certain moments were hard to watch.gripping mesmerizing the disinterest and betrayal by the admiration is on full display.it was difficult for me to follow who was bad and who was good that's part of the point of this movie they didn't know either very interesting movie but i had trouble following all the action scenes thank goodness i had read the book 91 watched this on 25 10 1613 hours is michael_bay's most hearfelt and restrained film yet critics find it incumbent upon them to criticize this just because it has the director's name in it the film has gorgeous action scenes packed with some great cinematography it is more emotional and realistic than any other film bay has ever made moreover it does not cover itself in patriotic shit like the film that were much favoured such as american_sniper it also effectively portrays the confusion and chaos spread around in that time of crisis and bay finds sufficient time to include sarcastic humour the cast does justice to their roles and there are some terrific one liners between them 5_stars best movie i've_seen in a while i cannot let go of the experience i was just in with the mercenary soldiers in benghazi_libya extremely hostile gripping eye_opening great production quality rent it not for familyincredibly brave and selfless men a great movie and tribute to those trapped in hell 13_hours may very well be michael_bay's best drama and some of his best filmmaking since the rock i love this movie a love song serenading our usually unsung heroes so ordinary yet so fearless the right stuff always follows unreasonable sometimes delirious orders at the expense of their precious life like the few hindered firefighters that ran up the collapsing towers the sound effect of the fights could be muted a bit to cut down the too crude violence maybe with slow motions like the ending scenes of the 3 heroes bravo kind of a meh film 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi its supposed to tell a true_story but after seeing this movie its hard to believe some dialogues are just dumb and filled with testosterone and the movie is so so boring sometimes never get that momentum filling that impact that should have nevertheless we have some nice action_sequences and thats all folks.intense and emotional and probably the most mature michael_bay movie i've_ever seen 13_hours does a good job at handling its true_story with honor.totally a great movie.tiring and boring action sequence doesn't offer enough heart wrenching disaster time story that you might expect from the title.the critics who made bad reviews should feel ashamed of themselves for desecrating the documentary film about the men who died trying to defend their base for their country shame on you hater critics shame on you also i loved this movie it rocked.hard not to have your blood boil seeing this and knowing what we know now of how the whole episode was addressed by our_government officials.pretty good emotional story to watch worth renting.eye opening and well_acted john krazynski sp did an excellent job and a departure from jim from the office prepare to walk away feeling a little angry at what our_government let slide.strong action strong cliches b13 hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is directed by michael_bay and it stars john_krasinski james_badge dale and pablo_schreiber in an action film about a group of soldiers in benghazi that's protecting the city and then all of a sudden there are a lot of rebellious people with guns going against every american that are in benghazi i was curious to see this not because of michael_bay as a director but because of the event that happened there and chuck hogan's writing debut for a film to my surprised this film is michael_bay's most mature film from his career the acting is very solid which i wasn't expected to see john_krasinski do very well as an action lead the action scenes are well_done which is basically most of the film that is a bit like black_hawk down and the gore effects is really good which is unexpected from michael_bay the writing by chuck hogan is fine for the most part that is as there are some corny dialogue in this that makes me go really the characters are not that memorable as the development on the soldiers are that either they have family or a wife and that's it krasinski's character is the most developed character but some of it aren't that necessary as there are scenes about his development that we already_know about the movie shouldn't rally be that long of a film and could've been cut down a bit there are some humor moments that were odd but there are humor moments that got a laugh out of me and doesn't feel like there's a comic relief character as is 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi is a great film that doesn't feel like a michael_bay film.the survivors of benghazi said that the movie is exactly as they remembered it the critics panned it because most are self loathing liberals and they couldn't possibly recommend it killary said that benghazi was the direct result of a video that no one ever saw that is the alternative realty that the left wants you to believe watch this movie and learn the truth you will be entertained at the same time.a rather avg movie it's fun to see the main_character in a different role from his usual movies but other than that you'll easily forget about this movie right after watching itthe action is really good and suspenseful but michael has a tough time developing a story and keeping us engaged for the duration of a film.so well_done great action movie and well actedgreat movie these_men are real herosyep another good one go get em.a security_team struggle to hold off an attack on an american diplomatic_compound in libya in this powerful drama.i was amazed a michael bayhem movie that i enjoyed krazinski does a fine job with the role politics is hinted at but never explicitly brought into the film a fine job.clearly the liberals didnt have much of a choice but to dislike this one.avoided this because i thought it would be too politicized after watching it on a trusted friends recommendation i would recommend it to anyone whether you are on the right or left side of the fence add siege at jadotville to your list as a must watch too and you will see we haven't gone that far in several decades we are still making the same mistakes.great movie appreciate what these_men did wasn't sure what to expect with this great stuff edge of seat tension and street battle action great technical realism and all based_on true events the embassy attack deaths that attracted criticism for then sec of state hillary_clinton though all the contractors look like dan bilzerian for some reason pdecent movie that tells some of the truth pretty realistic enough so i left the theater early not because it was bad or i was bored just didn't need some reminders.i recommend people see it or at_least research some of the facts forgotten heroes don't get talked about in the news the news only brings up heroes when they think they have a gotcha when they the media think the solider did something wrong or illegal.like most michael_bay movies you'll have trouble following the action during some sequences but it's an interesting story overall.solid army brotherhood film.despite its intense action_sequences this film's pace is rather slow michael_bay's direction is good and john krasinkski and james_badge dale are great.if you liked american_sniper lone_survivor and black_hawk down then this is one for you the story of a covert cia contracted private security_team in libya 2012 when the us ambassador is murdered in an attack on the embassy they fight a desperate defence of their compound against overwhelming odds the action is relentless and at_times gritty but is engrossing.stunningly a decent and serious movie from michael_bay the action is incredibly well shot and the pounding music effectively add to the tension film suffers greatly from a narrow minded point of view on the political and militaristic aspect of the conflict though.great action and plenty of carnage however the plot is a little incoherent and at_times it plays more like a documentary but it's classic michael bay.the audio seemed poor and i couldn't understand much of the dialogue that made it a bit frustrating to me.cia put heaven there we seeif you can watch this film and not think that hillary_clinton is as a idiot you're an idiot.it was almost like watching black_hawk downperhaps the best bayhem you'll ever see and beards.after watching this movie i don't see how anyone could ever support obama or hillary this is an amazing story it bring out a lot of emotions from anger that more wasn't done to help this men pride in those that serve and sadness for those that died as a movie it has moment of humor action and sadness this might be the best micheal_bay film ever this movie is right up there with american_sniper and lone_survivor powerful movie with great acting and a wonderful story.from the start the dialogue is convoluted way too many characters at once what makes a great movie is images and emotion i.e american_sniper lord of rings 300 etc contrast is clear typical of the director michael_bay to over due the flames and explosions but the movie and story line is insanely good keeps you on the edge of your_seat is a real tear jerker.pretty true to the book had some moment where it dragged a little bit but overall a solid movie with solid acting.great fact based movie keeping in mind the horror these soldiers went through those 13_hours must have felt like 24 great acting this movie brings you into bengazi kelps you there and leaves you wanting answers to questions.a decent historical military drama that has high production values and lots of action but feels rather shallow worth a watch for fans of the genre but everyone else can skip it.great movie learn a few new things about the attack that i did not know before probably on of michael_bay best movies grade anot a bad movie and very toned_down action movie from michael bay.good acting from a surprisingly good cast.action packed movie after the initial 45 minute intro a great and sad movie rotten tomato for a 50 on this film.excellent film and seems to really try to tell the story of these_men loved it.libya 2012 at an unofficial cia_base in benghazi a group of ex military contractors are providing security in the aftermath of gaddafi's downfall a power vacuum exists and the climate is volatile military weapons are freely available the us ambassador to libya chris stevens makes a visit to the area staying in a compound near the cia_base on the night of 11 september 2012 the ambassador's compound is attacked by hordes of heavily armed locals the only forces willing and able to defend it are six cia contractors.before seeing it i was very skeptical about this movie it clearly starts at a disadvantage being directed by michael_bay he of the explosion centric all style no substance plots plus the timing seemed very suspicious being released in a us election year with hillary_clinton running for president and the benghazi attack being a controversial mark on her record as secretary of state so the movie seemed to have a political agenda.thankfully my fears were unfounded and the movie is surprisingly good and apolitical well told with a good build_up giving the main characters some depth and setting the scene well when the action starts it is not all unrealistic heroics but fairly plausible battle scenes there is a degree of overuse of pyrotechnics by michael_bay but it wouldn't be a michael_bay movie without it.quite compelling viewing from a point as the battle gets tenser and tenser and the odds greater.solid performances too.easily the best michael_bay movie though not that this says much.probably one of michael_bays best filmsridiculous war porn.this is the best action war movie since black_hawk down john_krasinski excels in a serious role and the cinematography is top_notch this is not a typical michael_bay action movie either the explosions are reasonable and the action is not over the top.it's better_than the critics will have you believe and its long run time passes quickly but it does suffer from a few corny moments.this film was so intense i was on the edge of my_seat the entire time.typical of a michael_bay film explosions and gunfire are abundant there is little exploration of the actual conflict that caused this true event to unfold but the action keeps the film moving a little humor also helps from time to time overall worth the rental.i love this movie from beginning to end the story is tragic but wonderful because it clearly shows there are people who will stand and defend others because it is what they were made to do all of the soldiers have families waiting for them their family relationships the camaraderie they share their_own moral code these are special and keep the movie from just being about gunplay the casting is excellent the acting is great i've_seen the interview with three of the survivors and the film depicts them perfectly despite some people's interpretation of this film it is very apolitical.an enjoyable watch but like any other bay's movies it lacks the cutting substance to make it a good movie.a good solid film ultimately let down by the standard americanisation cheese that hollywood love to add into their movies a few throwaway lines stop this film being better_than it could be as well as a biased opinion and not eve a slight viewpoint from the other side of the incident overall a decent movie that's worth a watch and makes you feel for those people.there might be a masterpiece hiding behind the michael_bay isms of this movie but nontheless this is one of his best movies the action and set_pieces are outstanding and the acting is on point but the writing is sloppy and the movie is overly long a very good movies as a blockbluster action flick but noting more than that where it could have_been utter sexist garbage impossible to watchgreat sound editing not overstated authenticif there was a chance you imagined this was going to be thoughtfully rendered picture about a politically divisive tragedy michael_bay makes sure this a generic action blaster where brown people deserve to get shot bureaucrats bumble and red blooded bearded americans are the galaxies last hope.boomboom 11 bangkapow 1 1 muricafuckyeahpenisp enispenisdestroooooooyyyyyy but we're also family guys so show some compassion yeah

decente.pleasantly surprising i was dodging this movie because i didn't want to see a political message movie someone told me there was no political message in the movie so i gave it a try while on an international flight they were right this is a good movie and well worth a watch and would have thought that jim from the office could turn into an action star solidly entertaining action with a realistic view of the horrors and struggles of war the acting seemed a little over the top at_times but was is volatile and emotional overall it was a fantastic movie depicting real_life american heros.i don't the actual_events in this true_story played out as depicted in this film but it was highly entertaining none the lessgood action_packed unfortunate situationmay god_bless all of our service men women each.great movie exciting the whole time very patriotic excellent acting all around would recommended this action movie to anyone.considering a guy like michael_bay brought a guy out of comedy to play the lead he did phenomenal work the brotherhood portrayed and the courage to go out and put other before yourself that we see is i'm really certain very similar to the actual night very filled with impact emotion and power.michael bay has gone where no american has gone before fuck up benghazibest thing michael_bay ever did.i watched the movie and all along i reckoned that this is a movie that is not taking the subject_matter seriously and is incredibly self indulgent and then the credits rolled and michael_bay was the director wow it all made sense.this movie has great acting and bay's strength is cinematography and slick the former was great the latter was distracting.this movie was at_least 30_minutes too long.it was far too contrived ex the repetitive flashbacks to these contractors talking to their families back home it was also not a true story.but it was worth_watching the acting violence love that and suspense was excellent the rest all subpar imo.one of the years best films excellent story about a situation that should not have ever gotten to the point that it didone of the most tragic and contentious terrorist_attacks in recent memory was the raid on the american compound in benghazi_libya on september_11 2012 which left four americans dead while the attack has been politicized to the core michael_bay was successfully able to capture the events of the day in an objective and respectful way in the dramatic thriller 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi the film is atypical of bay's normal fare and that's a good thing while there are plenty of action_sequences given the subject_matter it's clear things are toned_down from the ridiculous over the top antics from the transformers franchise instead what we have is a portrait of courage under fire as a band of ex military brothers turned defense contractors are activated to defend the outpost as it is overrun by libyans who engage in guerrilla warfare.aside from the obvious villains profiled here 13_hours focuses on the key point of the delay in giving the contractors the go ahead which has become a sticking point and lightning rod for many in the years following the attack it was the cia station's director bob david_costabile who was pegged as the antagonist here which was probably the easiest way to wipe hands of politics for the rest of the cast a largely unknown cast is led by john_krasinski as jack_silva and james_badge dale as tyrone role woods.at two hours and 24 minutes 13_hours is a lengthy runtime for any kind of movie but given the subject_matter it makes sense in this instance there are so many aspects of the events that unfolded during this attack that every minute was necessary in order to deliver a sufficient and mostly accurate final product from the initial setup and character_development to the tear jerking final moments the film is an example of what can be achieved with a production team that clearly did its homework 13_hours may have only been a modest box office hit and received lukewarmly by critics but it still deserves a great deal of accolades.intense lays down the foundation of the immediate situation well of a country in anarchy and alericand left without the proper support or defense a little slow at the start but never boring.deffinitly a great movie for being a true_story word has it that almost every scene is on point with the main details.despite some good military action and the importance of this aspect of the story to be told this could have_been better and not so over overly dramatized 13_hours was a good movie looking at the action_packed fighting killing and explosions however if you are looking at the political side of the event almost nothing of that was added in while michael_bay displayed a full blast use of explosives and fighting and kept it going from the start to the end of the film it shows the soldiers as hard nosed men who get their rush of adrenaline from working out and shooting at and killing people it provides great fighting and war entertainment but never touching on the political side of it was a little bit of a shame for me i would've liked to see something put in about the decisions made across the world from the united_states no one was cast to play as hilary clinton giving orders on making security more safe leaving the base more vulnerable and easier to attack apart from that 13_hours was a good action_packed war movie.great story and very well done.michael bay is not my_favorite storyteller but i appreciate his effort he's solid at directing those action_sequences i'll give him that.amazing film micheal_bay kicked ass this movie only proves the criminal acts by hillary_clinton and the countless lives she destroyed heartbreaking and gut wrenching.sure in the beginning and end there is the usual cool us boys banter and family videos with a certain disdain for anyone who doesn't know how to shoot and kill however the long middle section of the events is high adrenaline action both uncomfortable and engaging bay knows how to film and cut such scenes and they make for a very entertaining film whether this has much to do with what actually happened in benghazi that night is for someone else to decide other director's like bigelow would have made a much more political film but as far as the action goes there is nothing to complain here.macho standard michael_bay issue lots of guns bullets slo mo and male emotions.although some scenes show general hate or not liking of almost everyone who isn't american it was a good flick.amazing just amazing so much action it's awesome if your an action you'll love this recommended.not the best military movie i've_seen in a while.a pretty standard military movie lots of great action and things going boom.captivating great movie and helps understand the intensity of war life.don't let the critics fool you this movie was well done.it deserve oscars nomination that s only i can tell the sound works is so great.typical michael_bay but entertaining nonetheless i'll leave the politics of what_happened to someone else.having simply stumbled across this movie while channel surfing i was at first just surprised to see john krazinski in something outside of the office so i settled in for a popcorn military flick that's probably like many other that came before and it was but in the sense that to me it portrayed the events heroism and sacrifices of these_men wonderfully i wasnt fully aware of the actual incident and i understand some dramatic licence will have_been used but this was an eye_opening guys not afraid to cry auctioned packed belter ok so it may not have_been on par with lone_survivor or amierican sniper there were a few shots that i found a little lacking and maybe cheesy but all in all an excellent movie that i'm glad i found if only to have learned the names of the heroes involved.screw the official review this movie is the best military action film i have seen since black_hawk down amazing and wonderful with details and true to life facts about the tragedy itself.much better_than expected given michael_bay directed it realistic and not too much grenade flaming napalm scenes.bay adds an undeniably decent gloss to this true_story and provides a couple of harrowing action scenes otherwise this is just a macho jingoistic and incomprehensible war drama that seems to hate women as much as it hates clarity people die and we're asked to care but everyone is so lacking in depth it's hard to tell any of them apart poor kransinski he clearly worked out like crazy he's good when he's given the opportunity but he's mostly wasted.one of the best movies_i've probably ever_seen brought me to tears at the end i remember watching the news like it was yesterday when benghazi happened.a stirring tribute to the fallen who lost their_lives in the service of a country that abandoned them for shame mrs clinton.if you can't respect what our military does for our_country then idk what to tell you.loved it cia clandestine is legitthe action is pretty intense however the acting is just horrible there is some stupid one liners overall it's a good action flick that relies solely on action to get your attention.good mike overall just can't see john k as a soliderit was an average war movie.exactly the type of story and film i wanted to watch on memorial day.very good movie similar to black_hawk down it's not your typical michael_bay movie which is a good thing it is pretty intense the entire 2hrs a deep and emotional look at the events of benghazi one of micheal bays deeper pictures it also doesnt demonise or seek to politicise either side of the conflict whoch is very respectful.the best homosexual dream come true movie since top gunthis is michael_bay toned_down a notch and i do mean by a notch because it's still so patently bay esque eratic pacing storytelling and bloated runtime terrible dialogue the action scenes aren't tense they're just chaotic even if they're relatively well shot but certainly not spectacularly so i actually recall the action in act of valour being better and since that and 13_hours rely more less on action over anything else then i actually preferred act of valour which ought to tell you something and no not about my personal taste in film 13_hours really is that unengaging then there's the typical lame bay humour the kind which only himself and other adolescent minded folk could find funny again it's toned_down but it's still there far more than its welcome contrived emotion and superficial sentimentality creep in as well you know to show us that these_guys have lives and families of their_own as if we couldn't have guessed that anyway if you're going to do something and label it as a true_story where real people's lives are affected then you better do it properly and by that token not get michael_bay to direct it and insult the memory of those affected this no mistake this ain't no black_hawk down or lone_survivor 2.5 5 it is too bad this very important subject did not get first class attention too cartoonish.semplicemente il miglior film che michael_bay abbia mai diretto finalmente possiamo gustarci un film dagli ottimi effetti visivi e sonori con una sceneggiatura solida e buoni personaggi che riesce a sostenere tutta la sua lunga durata il film colpisce anche sotto l'aspetto emotivo un'assoluta novit\\xc3\\xa0 nel cinema di questo discusso regista che pare abbia scelto finalmente una sceneggiatura scritta come dio comanda le scene d'azione sono come sempre ben dirette e ben coreografate ed insieme agli ottimi dialoghi riescono a rendere onore al tema trattato molto delicato visto che si basa su una storia vera speriamo che serva da lezione al regista e speriamo che magari seguendo questa strada riesca a portare il suo cinema ad un livello pi\\xc3\\xb9 alto.this movie is not that great but it is better_than bay's last few transformers movies at_least the action_sequences are good but the characterization is horrible and the first act falls very flat it is worth_watching once but it isn't always as engaging as i wanted it to be.micheal bay proves he is a pleasing director when he wants to be.b although it is far from a perfect film 13_hours is both thrilling and a decently emotional film.excellent war story based_on a true_story about what happen in bengazi on sept 11,2012 when the american ambassador was killed by rebel forces and how the c.i.a and black ops had to defend themselves thru 13_hours of hostile forces michael_bay directed good actors.special effects storyline and watching the credits you saw the pictures od the real soldiers and their brief stories now.intense and emotional and probably the most mature michael_bay movie i've_ever seen 13_hours does a good job at handling its true_story with honor.it's smarter than i thought it would be i was expecting bad_boys type dialogue and just explosion after explosion but mr bay is actually trying to tell a story here don't watch with too high expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised by the gripping drama.loved it kept thinking how brave those men were.with a michael_bay movie you know what to expect lots of gun fights and lots of explosions 13_hours does not disappoint there's plenty of gunfire action and explosions in this film granted the characters could be flushed out better but the movie is still very entertaining to watch i thought the performances were good all across the board it may not be the deepest or most dramatic war movie around but it gets the point across well and it will keep you entertained.grim growling men growling grimly star in the most boring michael_bay movie yet at the very least it respects the real_life events and people it's based on.this movie is basically a step down from lone_survivor and a step above many of michael_bay's previous movies i enjoyed how badass all the american soldiers were and how it ended everyone always enjoys a movie where the good guys win i couldn't take the main_character john kraninski very seriously the whole time i was waiting for him to crack a joke and do the jim face from the office the story line was incredible and i enjoyed how it really showed what_happened that night in benghazi however the whole situation was unclear and i found myself very confused by what was happening during most parts in the beginning overall a great war film oh yea screw you hillary liberal movie critic activist give this great american movie 50 this is a great movie about true heroes heroism and americans well_done a must seethis is the greatest based off a true_story movie of all time i don't understand how this movie is not critically acclaimed 5 5 this is also one of the best war movies_i've seen this is probably one the best war movie of all time in my_opinion a must_see for anyone interested in thinly veiled propaganda a waste of time.restrained in its bay isms but still wearing its heart on its sleeve 13_hours is a surprising return to form by michael_bay it might be surface level in its treatment of the real_life event but one can't_help but feel the level of respect and care in the filmmaking.deja vu of black_hawk down of another disposal of a tyrant but failed installation of american democracy in a country that doesn't understand nor appreciate western political system consequently a vacuum created only to be filled by isis that will flourish to exact more violence and bloodshed locally and also in the western world for years to come greater evil replacing evil excruciatingly painful film to watch but i still did to satisfy my curiosity over this dirty political word benghazi since 2012 the great cover up of this benghazi fiasco by the deceitful hilary clinton and her boss barak obama had avoided a defeat by president hopeful mitt romney also my hero in 2012 michael_bay did an excellent job creating recreating the mayhem of fire fight explosions and gory mangling of the american mercenaries sure there were casualties on the rebel side too but it was hard to sympathise with these murderous ungrateful bastards biting the heroes that emancipated libya from the evil dictator gaddafi great sensesurround of bullets wheezing by and explosions galore because i have a 11 speaker home theatre system dont think my neighbors were happy with 2.5 hours cacophany yes it was a long long film on american mercenaries left stranded far far from home and massacred yet it was egregious for bay to avoid a segment on what the hack were hilary and barack doing or not doing back in capitol hill a surviving mercenary at the end of the film summed up beautifully the futility and stupidity of fighting foreign wars in unappreciative countries more so in muslim countries because usa will always be the big satan in the eyes of muslim countries he couldn't be more thankful that he did not die leaving a widow and three fatherless children because he fought in a war he didn't understand and in a country he didn't care not for all the mercenary money in the world is worth the stupidity and sorrow 13_hours is an example of what the infamous director can do in one of his more inspired moments but the film never leaves the shallows and is only interested in showcasing the bravery of the very american soldiers with as much bravado as possible benghazi was one of the more publicised political screw ups in recent us history that resulted in a great loss of life and you can't_help but feel that it should have_been treated with more respect but yes it is a bay film and he's doing what he does best by giving the audience another explosion filled action flick that'll pass the time nicely and entertain a good deal of people just don't expect anything thought_provoking or particularly affecting.actually it was more like two and a half hours with credits it only felt like thirteen hours.i thought 13_hours the secret_soldiers of benghazi was a good one the military and war is good it is based_on a true story.a whole lot of boring talk scenes and meh gunfights that made the whole thing a bore to watch there are some convincing performances however.bay's best in a long time the film was bit too_long the film being based_on true_story had all the elements to make a good thriller which the director has achieved only it felt too long13 hours is certainly better_than michael_bay's recent offerings but that really isn't saying much the movie is another smug self important propaganda piece that glorifies war.character dynamic keeps this riveting action_packed yet heartfelt film cruising along with no real flaws it's michael_bay's best film it's a must_see for any action war film junkie.great reenactment up to the broken limbs but the right thing involved killing a lot of lybians which are like so many worthless indians good for targets no consideration whatsoever only the usa guys are worthy of the romantic and heroic music getting ghaddafi out maybe was not the right thing either removing the top predator smaller predators started to gain weight and poise beside when they attacked lybia it was allowing killing as a solution the right example the beginning seems to show the country was suddenly in a desperate financial situation all the more to fuel a resentment toward the usa and motivating an attack.this is a true_story based movie michale bay you did it again the movie make you think what can happen in 13_hours during war zone.i fought it was great really good action and a great storyline to iti usually have no time for bay but i liked this one genuinely interesting the actors are good.a compelling based_on a true_story suspense action thriller that happens to have played a part in the 2016 elections those who are wondering what benghazi is all about should check it out then do some more reading yes it's michael_bay but when the story is good his cinematography is effective.this is a biographical war drama thriller film based_on the terrorist attack in benghazi_libya on a us diplomatic_compound the movie feels genuine the action is realistic no heroics and such still an edge of seat thriller ones the bullet started flying the action_sequences are well staged and beautifully shot it's supposedly fact based movie and is critical of us military politicians on not providing aid when it was possible.this was the best movie that i have ever_seen it's an entertaining and compelling film but make no mistake this movie still features all of michael_bay's completely unmotivated and unnecessary cuts shots use of slow_motion and musical queues.an amazing story about these contract soldiers and the battle of benghazi aside from the intense battle scenes you also get a sense of the struggle these soldiers face being away from their homes and families great flickthe men of the usa and the bravery to go so many flaws of others lost live but a few saved so many.solid movie long build_up for the first hour but the movie has a solid endingamazing one of my favoritesthis movie is basically propaganda anyone who believes that this move is a true_story is deluding themselves for their_own ideological purposes i guess otherwise its a good action movie but i believe this is fake news watch at your own risk.i think there's a brilliance to this movie that many reviewers miss it's not a story about the broader geopolitical significance of benghazi it's the story of six security contractors told from their perspective showing the events as they would have seen them is it difficult to know exactly what has happened to whom at what time yes it's called the fog of war and showing that to the audience isn't sloppy film making it's brilliant bay tells the story from the street level not from 30,000 feet from the street level things are ugly confusing and often disjointed.what's so secret about the secret_soldiers of benghazi 13_hours secret_soldiers of benghazi is an action_packed guns blazing leave you on the edge of your_seat movie the film is directed by one of the best men to show you as much action as he possibly can in one short seen michael_bay director of transformers who is widely known for large explosions non_stop action and special_effects that will have you feeling that you are in the movie yourself with the controversy of the events depicted in this film bay does not point any fingers at anyone or give blame it provides the perspective of the people that were there in benghazi fighting their attackers and trying to stay alive as all hell rains down on them 13_hours is the story of the two attacks by islamic militants ansar al sharia on the two united_states government outposts in benghazi and libya it depicts the effects it has mainly on a six man team of ex soldiers now contractors working for the c.i.a in an unknown compound the first_half of the movie provides little background information of previous events as well as little to no information on the characters in the movie other than jack john krasinkski who is more commonly known for his comedy act in the popular television show the office the other main soldier characters rone james_badge dale tanto pablo_schreiber boon dave denman tig dominic fomusa and oz max_martini seemingly all mesh together to almost be the same person the ex millitary now contractor who is paid help for the government and are just trying to survive until they can go home to the families they left behind the thing i found most interesting about this movie is in the title itself secret_soldiers is the movie trying to show everyone that there are heroes in this world that protect others from harm and danger and we don't even know who they are or what they are doing is this movie trying to show that hired contractors that work for a salary are replacing our armed forces only 1 percent of the entire american population serves in the united_states millitary and this movie is showing us who is out there doing it instead but instead of showing us another blackgate incident its showing us those that fight for the right through all the blood empty shells lying on the cement floor and large explosions coming from all over you can't tell what's happening emotion comes if it hasn't before of empathy towards those that were involved from those that lost their life's and will never be able to go home and raise their newly born son just as specific scenes like when mortars are raining down from above onto the rooftops killing the beloved tanto and damning his future of ever seeing his neborn son again to those that were just paid by the c.i.a for analysis 13_hours shows a non political way of a war movie and in the end even showing scenes of libyans who had lost their loved ones weeping and mourning their loss saying this is not what islam is about and sorry america 13_hours is an interesting take on those independent contractors and the story that follows them.ok over 2 hours 1 hour of macho conversations 1 hour plus of documentary action the latter makes this film well worth watching.puntaje original 5.5esto pasa cuando te lo tomas muy a pecho la idea de hacer una_pel\\xc3\\xadcula intensa y como resultado obtienes un film sofocante e inc\\xc3\\xb3modo evidentemente se esforzaron tanto por hacer buenas escenas de acci\\xc3\\xb3n que se olvidaron de escribir un gui\\xc3\\xb3n decente.if you were surprised by the recent news that nbc's the office's pretty boy john_krasinski is gonna be the next jack ryan then you haven't possible seen his against typecasting projects such as 13_hours or say promised land this one is a modern war movie about american elite soldiers in libya at its most_dangerous times defending unofficial cia_base from local militants.krasinski doesn't kick ass here yet as jack ryan he has to surely but he can shoot bad guys from afar as well as the next guy also tallness and beard help to make a real man out of boyish looking man no kidding aside he looks the part which is good because this is mostly what the screenplay expects from the stars here this and couple of video calls to families to show their human side.it's directed by michael_bay so you can expect two things a lot of explosive action and the movie being longer than needed.at 144 minutes the never ending war porn does get tiring especially as the story stays on the shallow side we don't get to see anything from libyan side maybe the original cut lasting four hours would be deeper and richer content wise.so it gets too monotonous for my taste all shooting and no strong story but i am not particularly interested in modern war movies so i may not the best judge of 13_hours and its qualities.but the other critics don't seem to like it much either 50 100 from rotten tomatoes 48 100 from metacritic so this does say something probably the site users are kinder 7.3 10 from imdb 82 100 from rotten tomatoes 6.8 10 from metacritic.what is surprising is that bay managed to pull all this off for paltry 50 million usd budget these days he's more used to directing movies three four times more expensive due to the man devoting his life for transformers franchise.by the way 13_hours is based_on a true_story and a book that was written about it filmed in malta and morocco.i am not a big fan of war movies but this was a great movie much better_than lone_survivor and far more realistic it showed the true nature on modern conflict and allowed the real characters of these heroes come through best movie of 2016 so far i'm sure those that don't matter won't give it any awards though.an intense gripping movie that despite its long running_time just flew by i'm no michael_bay fan but his particular directing talents are used to powerful effect here at_times i did find myself struggling to keep a geographical handle on where i was during the action scenes which may have_been down to the editing.some stronger characterisations of the main characters would have_been welcome but the overall effect of the movie was strong and it did hold my attention.great film depicting the bravery and heart of the united_states military combat ready soldier it is also an extremely accurate depiction of how a presidential administration can hamstring the combat effectiveness of american qrf's in world theaters that are deemed threat level critical i think everyone can agree that especially after viewing this film the united_states is very fortunate that hillary_clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election we definitely dodged a bullet there.one of the best movies in years highly recommendthe critics gave this movie such low ratings simply because of its subject_matter unfortunately at the end of the day this is an extremely well made film that tells a story that everyone needs to see the people who lost their_lives in this total lapse of judgment by our state_department under the guidance of hillary_clinton can never go forgotten.never intended to watch this movie but it was on one night when i woke up and i couldn't break away thought it would be the same old action movie but it was a tale of friendship loyalty and courage.as a war movie it's pretty solid ignore the critics who can't see past their_own self importance long enough to enjoy a movie for what it is the claims of political bias are bs as the movie doesn't mention any of the key political figures in d.c what is presented is the events as they unfolded from the view of the guys who were there that includes the frustration and confusion some critics and reviewers complain about the attackers being 2 dimensional or a faceless enemy the fact is that is how they would have_been seen at the time by the defenders in the moment they don't need to be anything more because the movie isn't about them or their reasons it's about the operators who were there their relationship with each_other and the odds stacked against them if you liked black_hawk down you'll like this.i am unclear why so many critics gave this a bad rating it is a very good film and portrays the action pretty well.i think this movie is the perfect example of how we can no longer trust movie critics anymore it's at 50 because the heavily liberal critics can't stand watching a movie that reminds the world of their horrible corrupt idol hilary clinton it's so sad that we're at this point where i'm hearing critics talk up black panther saying nonsense like first hero movie with a black man in the star role how stupid are these people have they never seen any blade movie or hancock or mib etc these critics are corrupt beyond belief.i really wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was don't let the critics get you down this movie if definitely worth a watch.great movie keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat great acting great writing great plot and character_development great action and effects great camera work.of course the leftist critics hated the movie the film gave a face to and a passionate and emotional view into the lives of the american heroes who were hamstrung and then abandoned to die by the left's czar obama and queen hillary at the hands of their favorite victimized group radical muslims.when i read the pantywaist leftists reviews of this film all i see are these sjw ad hominem jargon filled garbage blah_blah blah hyper masculinity blah_blah blah xenophobia blah_blah blah islamophobia guess what lib 82 of americans respect and admire our men and women in uniform how about rooting for our side for a change snowflake you'll notice a pattern in the critics who didn't like this movie this movie really drove home why you really should trust the audience score far more than the critic's score there is a huge faction of critics who have a certain worldview or just don't like michael_bay trust the audience on this one.it's a fantastic and tight movie however this shows the events in benghazi which could have_been avoided had it not been for hillary_clinton that explains the critic ratings as it often does when there's such a great disparity great movie must see.everyone except the libtard critics loved this movie.a well made not over the top factual film great actors with noone trying to steal the limelight very real scenes.just another example of how out of touch modern movie critics are this might not be a 9 or 10 but it is definitely in the upper echelon of war flicks they happen to lean hard left so rather than try to judge it for what it is they have to inject the hatred of what they perceive as the other side the truth is it didn't really politicize any of the major candidates or people it tried to show what_happened from the soldiers perspective it could have had heaps of clips of susan rice or clinton lying or showing the 500 security increase requests and placed it all on obama's doorstep but it didn't it was relatively tame but was a topic of embarrassment for the left so is immediately cast as propaganda the only thing you can say is that soldiers hate spies and this movie shows exactly how distrusting they are of the yalies overall it is one of the top modern war movies and i'm sorry but it hangs in with black_hawk down critics are so far from the mainstream its not even funny my hillary obama and gore wife who hates war movies gave it an 8.5 and didn't ever get the feeling like they were blaming anyone she just was in awe of some of the actions of some of the men and if you were not then you had already prejudged the movie.a amazing movie about the real_life events of the september_11 attack on the diplomatic_compound in benghazi_libya michael_bay did an amazing job and used the actual security contractors for technical detail on the set.this is a war movie starred by america instead of john_krasinski guys.intense and action packed.thoughtful portrayal with plenty of action.really liked the movie showed a different perspective than what was reported from the media.embarrassing over the top unrelenting posturing by protagonists with corny one liners throughout that are cringe worthy to the max i'd rather watch act of valour instead and that ain't saying much.i thought it was really good it was action all the way through the only thing i would say about it is that it dragged on for quite a while\\n\""
